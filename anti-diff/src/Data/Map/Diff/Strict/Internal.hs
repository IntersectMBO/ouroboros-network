-- | @h1 <> h2@ sums @h1@ and @h2@ by cancelling out as many consecutive diff
-- entries as possible.
--
-- Diff entries that are each other's inverse can cancel out. In this case, both
-- diff entries are removed the diff history.
--
-- Examples:
-- > [Insert 1, AntiDelete 2] <> [Delete 2, AntiInsert 1] = []
--
-- > [Insert 1, Delete 2]     <> [AntiDelete 2, Delete 3] = [Insert 1, Delete 3]

-- is given, and the results it produces. Because of this, the resulting diff
-- history can be nonsenical. To illustrate, consider example 2 given above: how
-- could we expect to delete a value @3@ if we inserted a value @1@? As such, it
-- is the using code's responsibility to ensure that the inputs given to the sum
-- lead to sensible results.
--
-- Note: We do not cancel out consecutive elements in @h1@ and @h2@
-- individually. It is only at the border between @h1@ and @h2@ that we cancel
-- out elements (see the third example given above).
