-- FIXME(jdral): In this section, we distinguish between scrutinous and
-- non-scrutinous application of diffs. For now, `consensus` libraries uses the
-- non-scrutinous version, since the scrutinous version will consistently throw
-- errors as sanity checks fail due to era translations and the multi-era nature
-- of on-disk ledger values like the UTxO. In particular, a UTxO that is read
-- from disk can either be from the current era, but also any one era before it.
-- A UTxO is translated to the current era such that we can use it in the
-- current era's ledger rules, but this translation information is then lost. A
-- translation to a new era is essentially an update, and as such should be
-- reflected in diffs, but that is currently not the case. We should use the
-- scrutinous version once the ledger implements tracking maps, in which case we
-- can keep track of exactly which era translations have happened.
