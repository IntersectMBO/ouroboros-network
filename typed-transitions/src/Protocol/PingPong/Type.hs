-- These involve transitions between different states within the 'StPingPong'
-- states. A ping request goes from idle to busy, and a pong response go from
-- busy to idle.
--
-- This example is so simple that we have all the messages directly as
-- constructors within this type. In more complex cases it may be better to
-- factor all (or related) requests and all responses within one case (in which
-- case the state transitions may depend on the particular message via the
-- usual GADT tricks).
