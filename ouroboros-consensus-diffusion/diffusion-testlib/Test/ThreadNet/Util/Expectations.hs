  }

-- | Compute a bound for the length of the final forks
--
-- At the end of the test, the nodes' final chains will share a common prefix
-- (\"intersection\"), though it may be empty. Each node's current chain is a
-- fork off that prefix. No such fork will be longer than the result of this
-- function.
--
-- ASSUMPTION: The network connectivity is such that -- barring other
-- non-network considerations -- any block forged at the start of a slot will
-- be fetched and possibly selected by every other node before the end of the
-- slot.
--
-- == How 'LeaderSchedule' affects this function
--
-- A round-robin 'LeaderSchedule' will always reach consensus, so the fork
-- length will be @0@. For other 'LeaderSchedule's -- whether known /a priori/
-- (see "Test.ThreadNet.LeaderSchedule") or /a posteriori/ (see
-- "Test.ThreadNet.Praos") -- we often will not expect consensus. The key
-- difference is that a round-robin schedule always has exactly one leader per
-- slot. Arbitrary schedules instead may have 0 or multiple leaders.
--
-- A sequence of slots in which no slot has exactly one leader can drive a
-- network away from consensus. This function bounds how far from consensus the
-- network could be after the last simulated slot. It determines a conservative
-- upper bound on the length of the contended suffix of the nodes' final
-- chains. The bound may be less than, equal, or greater than @k@; regardless
-- of which, it should be used to test the nodes' final chains.
--
-- If such a sequence is long enough, it might even prevent the network from
-- every reaching consensus again: the nodes at the end of the sequence may
-- have chains that disagree by more than @k@ blocks, thereby exceeding the
-- security parameter @k@. In particular, if the bound determined by a
-- 'LeaderSchedule' is greater than @k@, then no extension of that
-- 'LeaderSchedule' can determine a lesser bound.
--
-- Multiple leaders create divergent chains as follows. Assume that every
-- leader of @s + 1@ begins the slot with a chain of length @n@, and that no
-- chain in the network has a greater length. Each leader forges a unique
-- block. A race condition between ChainSync/BlockFetch and forging makes it
-- possible, though relatively unlikely, that a leader would have received
-- another leader's new block before it forges its own. In that case, the new
-- leader will forged a block but then not select it, since it already selected
-- the other leader's new block. This function assumes the \"worst-case\" in
-- which both leaders make separate chains, thereby breaking consensus. Hence
-- it computes an upper bound. Each leader thus selects a new @n+1@-length
-- chain, and each non-leader will adopt one of them because they previously
-- had a chain of length @<= n@. Thus the network is likely not in consensus at
-- the end of a multi-leader slot.
--
-- The network will reestablish consensus at the end of a single-leader slot,
-- because the leader creates the only chain of length @n+1@ and all other
-- nodes thus select it.
--
-- In a slot with no leaders, all nodes will simply retain their current
-- chains.
--
-- == How 'NodeJoinPlan' affects this function
--
-- Because the race condition between forging and ChainSync/BlockFetch is
-- consistently won by forging, a node that leads in the same slot it joins
-- always attempts to make a chain of length 1 (ASSUMPTION: new nodes start
-- with an empty chain). Except for the edge cases when the longest chains in
-- the network are of length 0 or 1, this means that leaders who are joining
-- can be disregarded.
