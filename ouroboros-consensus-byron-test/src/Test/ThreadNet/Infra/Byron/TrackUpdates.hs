  ProtocolVersion update proposals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

-- | The protocol info for a node as well as some initial transactions
--
-- The transactions implement a smoke test for the hard-fork from Byron to
-- Shelley. See PR #1741 for details on how that hard-fork will work. The key
-- fact is that last thing the nodes will ever do while running the Byron
-- protocol is adopt a specific (but as of yet to-be-determined) protocol
-- version. So this smoke test ensures that the nodes can in fact adopt a new
-- protocol version.
--
-- Adopting a new protocol version requires four kinds of event in Byron.
-- Again, see PR #1741 for more details.
--
--  * Proposal transaction. A protocol parameter update proposal transaction
--    makes it onto the chain (it doesn't have to actually change any
--    parameters, just increase the protocol version). Proposals are
--    'MempoolPayload.MempoolUpdateProposal' transactions; one is included in
--    the return value of this function. In the smoke test, we immediately and
--    repeatedly throughout the test add the proposal to @CoreNodeId 0@'s
--    mempool; this seems realistic.
--
--  * Vote transactions. A sufficient number of nodes (@floor (0.6 *
--    'pbftNumNodes')@ as of this writing) must vote for the proposal. Votes
--    are 'MempoolPayload.MempoolUpdateVote' transactions; one per node is
--    included in the return value of this function. In the smoke test, we
--    immediately and repeatedly throughout the test add each node's vote to
--    its own mempool; this seems realistic.
--
--  * Endorsement header field. After enough votes are 2k slots old, a
--    sufficient number of nodes (@floor (0.6 * 'pbftNumNodes')@ as of this
--    writing) must then endorse the proposal. Endorsements are not
--    transactions. Instead, every Byron header includes a field that specifies
--    a protocol version to endorse. At a particular stage of a corresponding
--    proposal's lifetime, that field constitutes an endorsement. At all other
--    times, it is essentially ignored. In the smoke test, we take advantage of
--    that to avoid having to restart our nodes: the nodes' initial
--    configuration causes them to immediately and always attempt to endorse
--    the proposed protocol version; this seems only slightly unrealistic.
--
--  * Epoch transition. After enough endorsements are 2k slots old, the
--    protocol version will be adopted at the next epoch transition, unless
--    something else prevents it. In the smoke test, we check the validation
--    state of the final chains for the new protocol version when we detect no
--    mitigating circumstances, such as the test not even being scheduled to
--    reach the second epoch.
