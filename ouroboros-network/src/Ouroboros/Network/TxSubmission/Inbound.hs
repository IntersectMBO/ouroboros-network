       -- transaction IDs in this 'Map' may be mapped to 'Nothing':
       --
       -- * Transaction IDs mapped to 'Nothing' can represent transaction IDs
       --   that were requested, but not received. This can occur because the
       --   client will not necessarily send all of the transactions that we
       --   asked for, but we still need to acknowledge those transactions.
       --
       --   For example, if we request a transaction that no longer exists in
       --   the client's mempool, the client will just exclude it from the
       --   response. However, we still need to acknowledge it (i.e. remove it

       --   longer awaiting receipt of that transaction.

       --   that were not requested from the client because they're already
       --   in the mempool.

       --   For example, if we request some transaction IDs and notice that
       --   some subset of them have are already in the mempool, we wouldn't
       --   want to bother asking for those specific transactions. Therefore,
