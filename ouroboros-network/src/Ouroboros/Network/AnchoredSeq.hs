  AnchoredSeq
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

-- | Generalisation of a @Sequence@ with elements of type @b@ with a custom
-- measure @v@ and an anchor @a@.
--
-- This type is strict in the elements, but not strict in the spine.
--
-- For example, an 'AnchoredSeq' can represent a fragment of a chain containing
-- blocks that is anchored at a certain point. It can also represent a history
-- of ledger states with the anchor being the \"immutable\" ledger state.
--
-- NOTE: there might be multiple elements with the same measure, e.g., multiple
-- blocks with the same @WithOrigin SlotNo@. That is why functions operating on
-- an 'AnchoredSeq' often take a predicate in addition to a measure. At most one
-- element should satisfy that predicate, e.g., the block must have a certain
-- hash. The behaviour is undefined when multiple elements satisfy the
-- predicate.

-- Filter out elements that don't match the predicate.
--
-- As filtering removes elements the result is a sequence of disconnected
-- sequences. The sequences are in the original order and are of maximum size.
--
-- As soon as the stop condition is true, the filtering stops and the remaining
-- sequence (starting with the first element for which the stop condition is
-- true) is the final sequence in the returned list.
--
-- The stop condition wins from the filtering predicate: if the stop condition
-- is true for an element, but the filter predicate not, then the element still
-- ends up in final sequence.
--
-- For example, given the sequence containing @[0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]@ where the
-- anchor is separated from the elements by @:@:
--
-- > filter         odd        -> [[0: 1], [2: 3], [4: 5]]
