-- Established peers below target
--


-- | If we are below the target of /warm peers/ we promote /cold peers/
-- according to 'policyPickColdPeersToPromote'.
--
-- There are two targets we are trying to hit here:
--
-- 1. a target for the overall number of established peers; and
-- 2. the target that all local root peers are established peers.
--
-- These two targets overlap: the conditions and the actions overlap since local
-- root peers are also known peers. Since they overlap, the order in which we
-- consider these targets is important. We consider the local peers target
-- /before/ the target for promoting other peers.
--
-- We will /always/ try to establish connections to the local root peers, even
-- if that would put us over target for the number of established peers. If we
-- do go over target then the action to demote will be triggered. The demote
-- action never picks local root peers.
