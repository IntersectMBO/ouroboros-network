-- Known peer set representation

-- a 'Set' of @peeraddr@.
--
-- It has two special features:
--
--  * It tracks which peers we are permitted to gossip with now, or for peers
--    we cannot gossip with now the time at which we would next be allowed to
--    do so.
--
--  * It tracks the subset of peers that we are happy to publish in reply to
--    gossip requests to our node. It supports random sampling from this set.

-- Selecting peers to advertise
--

-- | Select a random subset of the known peers that are available to publish.
--
-- The selection is done in such a way that when the same initial PRNG state is
-- used, the selected set does not significantly vary with small perturbations
-- in the set of published peers.
--
-- The intention of this selection method is that the selection should give
-- approximately the same replies to the same peers over the course of multiple
-- requests from the same peer. This is to deliberately slow the rate at which
-- peers can discover and map out the entire network.
