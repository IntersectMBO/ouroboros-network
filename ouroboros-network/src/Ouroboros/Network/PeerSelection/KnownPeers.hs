-- Selecting peers to advertise
--

-- | Select a random subset of the known peers that are available to publish.
--
-- The selection is done in such a way that when the same initial PRNG state is
-- used, the selected set does not significantly vary with small perturbations
-- in the set of published peers.
--
-- The intention of this selection method is that the selection should give
-- approximately the same replies to the same peers over the course of multiple
-- requests from the same peer. This is to deliberately slow the rate at which
-- peers can discover and map out the entire network.
