-- | An 'AnchoredFragment' is a 'ChainFragment' that is anchored to some
-- 'Point': the point right before the first, leftmost block in the fragment.
-- The anchor point can be thought of as a left exclusive bound.
--
-- For example, the following fragment is anchored at @a@ and contains @b1@,
-- @b2@, and @b3@, which is the head of the fragment.
--
-- > a ] b1 >: b2 >: b3
--
-- The fact that it is an /exclusive/ bound is particularly convenient when
-- dealing with Genesis. Genesis is the start of the chain, but not an actual
-- block, so we cannot use it an inclusive bound. However, there /is/ a
-- 'Point' that refers to Genesis ('Chain.genesisPoint'), which can be used as
-- the anchor point, acting as an exclusive bound.
--
-- An 'AnchoredFragment' anchored at Genesis, can thus be converted to a
-- 'Ouroboros.Network.Chain.Chain' ('toChain'), containing all blocks starting
-- from Genesis.
--
-- Without an anchor point, an empty 'ChainFragment' doesn't give us much more
-- information: is it empty because the whole chain is empty? Or, did we just
-- get an empty fragment that was split off from some later part of the chain?
--
-- Furthermore, an important criterion during chain selection is the length of
-- the chain. However, comparing the length of two 'ChainFragment's doesn't
-- make much sense, since they might start at different points. Hence the idea
-- to \"anchor\" fragments at some point, and require that fragments have the
-- same anchor when comparing their lengths.
--
-- Note: instead of comparing the lengths of two 'ChainFragment's, we could
-- try to compare the 'blockNo' of their heads, which is also a measure of the
-- total length of the chain. However, EBBs throw a(nother) spanner in the
-- works: each EBB shares its 'blockNo' with a regular block, so comparing a
-- 'ChainFragment' that only contains the EBB with a 'ChainFragment' that only
-- contains the regular block with the same 'blockNo' as the EBB, will not
-- give a conclusive preference to either fragment, while in reality one
-- fragment actually corresponds to a longer chain.
