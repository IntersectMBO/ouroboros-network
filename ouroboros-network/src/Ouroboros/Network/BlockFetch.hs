Notes:

 * Thread communication is via STM based state.
 * Outbound: threads update STM state.
 * Inbound: threads wait on STM state changing (using retry).
 * These are no queues: there is only the current state, not all change events.

We consider the block fetch logic and the policy for the block fetch protocol
client together as one unit of functionality. This is the shaded area in the
diagram.

Looking at the diagram we see that these two threads interact with each other
and other threads via the following shared state

+-----------------------------+----------------+--------------------+
|  State                      |  Interactions  | Internal\/External |
+=============================+================+====================+
|  Candidate chains (headers) |  Read          |  External          |
+-----------------------------+----------------+--------------------+
|  Current chain (blocks)     |  Read          |  External          |
+-----------------------------+----------------+--------------------+
|  Set of downloaded blocks   |  Read & Write  |  External          |
+-----------------------------+----------------+--------------------+
|  Block fetch requests       |  Read & Write  |  Internal          |
+-----------------------------+----------------+--------------------+

The block fetch requests state is private between the block fetch logic
and the block fetch protocol client, so it is implemented here.

The other state is managed by the consensus layer and is considered external
here. So here we define interfaces for interacting with the external state.
These have to be provided when instantiating the block fetch logic.
