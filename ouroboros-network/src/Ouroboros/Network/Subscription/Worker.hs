-- Worker
--

-- |  This is the most abstract worker, which puts all the pieces together.  It
-- will execute until @main :: Main m s t@ returns.  It runs
-- 'subscriptionLoop' in a new threads and will exit when it dies.  Spawn
-- threads are cancelled in a 'finally' callback by throwing 'SubscriberError'.
--
-- Note: This function runs in 'IO' only because 'MonadSTM' does not yet support
-- 'orElse', PR #432.
