module Ouroboros.Network.BlockFetch.Decision.Genesis
  ( -- * Genesis decision logic
    --
    -- | This module contains the part of the block fetch decisions process that is
    -- specific to the bulk sync mode. This logic reuses parts of the logic for the
    -- deadline mode, but it is inherently different.
    --
    -- Definitions:
    --
    -- - Let @inflight :: peer -> Set blk@ be the outstanding blocks, those that
    --   have been requested and are expected to arrive but have not yet.
    --
    -- - Let @peersOrder@ be an order of preference among the peers. This order is
    --   not set in stone and will evolve as we go.
    --
    -- - Let @currentPeer :: Maybe peer@ be the “current peer” with which we are
    --   interacting. If it exists, this peer must be the best according to
    --   @peersOrder@, and the last fetch request must have been sent to them.
    --
    -- - Let @currentStart :: Time@ be the latest time a fetch request was sent
    --   while there were no outstanding blocks.
    --
    -- - Let @gracePeriod@ be a small duration (eg. 10s), during which a “cold” peer
    --   is allowed to warm up (eg. grow the TCP window) before being expected to
    --   feed blocks faster than we can validate them.
    --
    -- One iteration of this decision logic:
    --
    -- 0. If @inflight(currentPeer)@ is non-empty and the block validation component
    --    has idled at any point after @currentStart@ plus @gracePeriod@, then the
    --    peer @currentPeer@ has failed to promptly serve @inflight(currentPeer)@,
    --    and:
    --
    --   - If @currentPeer@ is the ChainSync Jumping dynamo, then it must
    --     immediately be replaced as the dynamo.
    --
    --   - Stop considering the peer “current” and make them the worst according to
    --     the @peersOrder@.
    --
    -- 1. Select @theCandidate :: AnchoredFragment (Header blk)@. This is the best
    --    candidate header chain among the ChainSync clients (eg. best raw
    --    tiebreaker among the longest).
    --
    -- 2. Select @thePeer :: peer@.
    --
    --    - Let @grossRequest@ be the oldest block on @theCandidate@ that has not
    --      already been downloaded.
    --
    --    - If @grossRequest@ is empty, then terminate this iteration. Otherwise,
    --      pick the best peer (according to @peersOrder@) offering the block in
    --      @grossRequest@.
    --
    -- 3. Craft the actual request to @thePeer@ asking blocks of @theCandidate@:
    --
    --    - If the byte size of @inflight(thePeer)@ is below the low-water mark,
    --      then terminate this iteration.
    --
    --    - Decide and send the actual next batch request, as influenced by exactly
    --      which blocks are actually already currently in-flight with @thePeer@.
    --
    -- 4. If we went through the election of a new peer, replace @currentPeer@ and
    --    put the new peer at the front of @peersOrder@. Also reset @currentStart@
    --    if @inflights(thePeer)@ is empty.
    --
    -- Terminate this iteration.

    -- * About the influence of in-flight requests
    --
    -- | One can note that in-flight requests are ignored when finding a new peer, but
    -- considered when crafting the actual request to a chosen peer. This is by
    -- design. We explain the rationale here.
    --
    -- If a peer proves too slow, then we give up on it (see point 0. above), even
    -- if it has requests in-flight. In subsequent selections of peers (point 2.),
    -- the blocks in these requests will not be removed from @theCandidate@ as, as
    -- far as we know, these requests might not return (until the connection to that
    -- peer is terminated by the mini protocol timeout).
    --
    -- When crafting the actual request, we do need to consider the in-flight
    -- requests of the peer, to avoid clogging our network. If some of these
    -- in-flight requests date from when the peer was previously “current”, this
    -- means that we cycled through all the peers that provided @theCandidate@ and
    -- they all failed to serve our blocks promptly.
    --
    -- This is a degenerate case of the algorithm that might happen but only be
    -- transient. Soon enough, @theCandidate@ should be honest (if the consensus
    -- layer does its job correctly), and there should exist an honest peer ready to
    -- serve @theCandidate@ promptly.

    -- * Interactions with ChainSync Jumping (CSJ)
    --
    -- | Because we always require our peers to be able to serve a gross request
    -- with an old block, peers with longer chains have a better chance to pass
    -- this criteria and to be selected as current peer. The CSJ dynamo, being
    -- always ahead of jumpers, has therefore more chances to be selected as the
    -- current peer. It is still possible for a jumper or a disengaged peer to be
    -- selected.
    --
    -- If the current peer is the CSJ dynamo and it is a dishonest peer that retains
    -- blocks, it will get multiple opportunities to do so since it will be selected
    -- as the current peer more often. We therefore rotate the dynamo every time it
    -- is the current peer and it fails to serve blocks promptly.

    -- * About the gross request
    --
    -- | We want to select a peer that is able to serve us a batch of oldest blocks
    -- of @theCandidate@. However, not every peer will be able to deliver these
    -- batches as they might be on different chains. We therefore select a peer only
    -- if its candidate fragment contains the block in the gross request. In this
    -- way, we ensure that the peer can serve at least one block that we wish to
    -- fetch.
    --
    -- If the peer cannot offer any more blocks after that, it will be rotated out
    -- soon.
