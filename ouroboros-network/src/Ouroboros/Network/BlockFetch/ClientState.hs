-- STM TFetchRequestVar
--

-- | The 'TFetchRequestVar' is a 'TMergeVar' for communicating the
-- 'FetchRequest's from the logic thread to a fetch client thread.
--
-- The pattern is that the logic thread determines a current request and this
-- is written to the var with 'writeTMergeVar'. The fetch client thread uses
-- 'takeTMergeVar', which blocks until a value is available. On the other hand,
-- 'writeTMergeVar' never blocks, if a value is already present then it
-- overwrites it. This makes sense for the fetch requests because if a fetch
-- client has not accepted the request yet then we can replace it with the
-- request based on the more recent state.
