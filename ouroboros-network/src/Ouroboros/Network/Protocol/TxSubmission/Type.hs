-- | The kind of the transaction-submission protocol, and the types of the
-- states in the protocol state machine.
--
-- We describe this protocol using the label \"client\" for the peer that is
-- submitting transactions, and \"server\" for the one receiving them. The
-- protocol is however pull based, so it is typically the server that has
-- agency in this protocol. This is the opposite of the chain sync and block
-- fetch protocols, but that makes sense because the information flow is also
-- reversed: submitting transactions rather than receiving headers and blocks.
--
-- Because these client\/server labels are somewhat confusing in this case, we
-- sometimes clarify by using the terms inbound and outbound. This refers to
-- whether transactions are flowing towards a peer or away, and thus indicates
-- what role the peer is playing.
--
data TxSubmission txid tx where

  -- | The server (inbound side) has agency; it can either terminate, ask for
  -- transaction identifiers or ask for transactions.
  --
  -- There is no timeout in this state.
  --
  StIdle   :: TxSubmission txid tx

  -- | The client (outbound side) has agency; it must reply with a
  -- list of transaction identifiers that it wishes to submit.
  --
  -- There are two sub-states for this, for blocking and non-blocking cases.
  --
  StTxIds  :: StBlockingStyle -> TxSubmission txid tx

  -- | The client (outbound side) has agency; it must reply with the list of
  -- transactions.
  --
  StTxs    :: TxSubmission txid tx

  -- | Nobody has agency; termination state.
  --
  StDone   :: TxSubmission txid tx


data StBlockingStyle where

  -- | In this sub-state the reply need not be prompt. There is no timeout.
  --
  StBlocking    :: StBlockingStyle
  
  -- | In this state the peer must reply. There is a timeout.
  --
  StNonBlocking :: StBlockingStyle


-- | There are some constraints of the protocol that are not captured in the
-- types of the messages, but are documented with the messages. Violation
-- of these constraints is also a protocol error. The constraints are intended
-- to ensure that implementations are able to work in bounded space.
--
instance Protocol (TxSubmission txid tx) where

  -- | The messages in the transaction submission protocol.
  --
  -- In this protocol the consumer (inbound side, server role) always
  -- initiates and the producer (outbound side, client role) replies.
  -- This makes it a pull based protocol where the receiver manages the
  -- control flow.
  --
  -- The protocol involves asking for transaction identifiers, and then
  -- asking for transactions corresponding to the identifiers of interest.
  --
  -- There are two ways to ask for transaction identifiers, blocking and
  -- non-blocking. They otherwise have the same semantics.
  --
  -- The protocol maintains a notional FIFO of \"outstanding\" transaction
  -- identifiers that have been provided but not yet acknowledged. Only
  -- transactions that are outstanding can be requested: they can be
  -- requested in any order, but at most once. Transaction identifiers are
  -- acknowledged in the same FIFO order they were provided in. The
  -- acknowledgement is included in the same messages used to ask for more
  -- transaction identifiers.
  --
  data Message (TxSubmission txid tx) from to where

    -- | Request a non-empty list of transaction identifiers from the client,
    -- and confirm a number of outstanding transaction identifiers.
    --
    -- With 'TokBlocking' this is a a blocking operation: the response will
    -- always have at least one transaction identifier, and it does not expect
    -- a prompt response: there is no timeout. This covers the case when there
    -- is nothing else to do but wait. For example this covers leaf nodes that
    -- rarely, if ever, create and submit a transaction.
    --
    -- With 'TokNonBlocking' this is a non-blocking operation: the response
    -- may be an empty list and this does expect a prompt response. This
    -- covers high throughput use cases where we wish to pipeline, by
    -- interleaving requests for additional transaction identifiers with
    -- requests for transactions, which requires these requests not block.
    --
    -- The request gives the maximum number of transaction identifiers that
    -- can be accepted in the response. This must be greater than zero in the
    -- 'TokBlocking' case. In the 'TokNonBlocking' case either the numbers
    -- acknowledged or the number requested must be non-zero. In either case,
    -- the number requested must not put the total outstanding over the fixed
    -- protocol limit.
    --
    -- The request also gives the number of outstanding transaction
    -- identifiers that can now be acknowledged. The actual transactions
    -- to acknowledge are known to the peer based on the FIFO order in which
    -- they were provided.
    --
    -- There is no choice about when to use the blocking case versus the
    -- non-blocking case, it depends on whether there are any remaining
    -- unacknowledged transactions (after taking into account the ones
    -- acknowledged in this message):
    --
    -- * The blocking case must be used when there are zero remaining
    --   unacknowledged transactions.
    --
    -- * The non-blocking case must be used when there are non-zero remaining
    --   unacknowledged transactions.
