-- | An example @'TxSubmissionClient'@ which sends transactions from a fixed
-- list of transactions.
--
-- It is intended to illustrate the protocol or for use in tests. The client
-- enforces aspects of the protocol. It will fail with a protocol error if
-- the peer asks for a transaction which is not in the unacknowledged set.
-- The unacknowledged set is managed such that things are removed after having
-- been requested. The net effect is that the peer can only ask for 
-- * If a server will ask for
-- the same transaction twice.
