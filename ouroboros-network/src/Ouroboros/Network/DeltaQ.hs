-- | A \"ùö´Q\" is a probability distribution on the duration between two events.
-- It is an \"improper\" probability distribution in that it may not integrate
-- to 1. The \"missing\" probability mass represents failure. This allows both
-- timing and failure to be represented in one mathematical object.
--
-- In the case of networks a ùö´Q can be used for example distributions such as
-- the time for a leading edge or trailing edge of a packet to traverse a
-- network (or failing to do so), and many others besides.

-- | The point in time in the distribution for which 99% of the probability
-- mass is before that time.
--
-- This tells us how long we would have to wait to have a 99% chance of the
-- end event having happened. Of course 99% is somewhat arbitrary and other
-- points in the distribution could be of interest.
--
-- TODO: this needs to be specified better for improper distributions.

-- | This is another way of looking at a ùö´Q distribution. Instead of giving
-- a fraction of the probability mass (like 99%) and asking how long we would
-- have to wait, we can say how long we are prepared to wait and ask what
-- fraction of the probability mass is before that time.
--
-- So this tells us the chance of the end event happening within the time we
-- are prepared to wait. This is useful for evaluating different options for
-- which has the greatest probability of success within a deadline.

-- Sketch of API for GSV
--

-- | A \"GSV\" corresponds to a ùö´Q that is a function of the size of a data
-- unit to be transmitted over a network. That is, it gives the ùö´Q of the
-- transmission time for different sizes of data in 'SizeInBytes'.
--
-- The ùö´Q is broken out into three separate ùö´Q distributions, ùö´Q‚à£G, ùö´Q‚à£S and
-- ùö´Q‚à£V, with the overall ùö´Q being the convolution of the three components.
-- The G and S components captures the /structural/ aspects of networks, while
-- the V captures the /variable/ aspects:
--
-- [/G/]: the /geographical/ component of network delay. This is the minimum
--        time to transmit a hypothetical zero-sized data unit. This component
--        of the distribution does not depend on the data unit size. It is
--        a degenerate distribution, taking only one value.
--
-- [/S/]: the /serialisation/ component of network delay. This is time to
--        serialise a data unit as it is being transmitted. This is of course
--        a function of the data unit size. For each size it is a degenerate
--        distribution, taking only one value.
--
-- [/V/]: the /variable/ aspect of network delay. This captures the variability
--        in network delay due to issues such as congestion. This does not
--        depend on the data unit size, and is /not/ a degenerate disruption.
--
-- For ballistic transmission of packets, /S/ is typically directly proportional
-- to the size. Thus the combination of /G/ and /S/ is simply a linear function
-- of the size.
--

-- | The current tracking model is based on an EWMA
--  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average).
--  Typically implementations of EWMA assume a regular update, but EWMA is based
--  on Exponential Smoothing
--  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing). Such smoothing has a
--  time constant, which captures the time for a unit impulse to decay to 1 -
--  1/e (~ 63.2%), the &#x1D6FC (smoothing factor) is a function of relative
--  frequency of the sample interval and this time constant.
--
-- The approach being taken here is one that does not assume a fixed sample
-- interval (and hence a fixed &#x1D6FC), instead we calculate, given the
-- interval from when the last sample was taken, the &#x1D6FC needed to ensure
-- that the old value has sufficiently decayed.
--
-- The exact calcuation involves exponentiation, however where the number of
-- samples within the time constant is sufficiently large a simple ratio of the
-- sample's interval over the time constant will suffice. The relative error of
-- this numerical approximation is, for our use case, small. Eg 1/50 (20s
-- between samples with a 1000s time constant) has a relative error of 1%. The
-- expected typical range of this relative error is between 5% (ratio of 1/10),
-- to 0.5% (1/100).
--
-- Given the inherent measurement noise in this measurement, the use of the
-- approximation is well justified. We choose (reaonably aribtarily) 1000s as
-- the time constant, it is unclear if this should be a configuration variable
-- or not.
-- Note that this semigroup is  is non-commutative. The new value must come first.
