-- | Monitor 'UseBootstrapPeers' flag.
--
-- The user might reconfigure the node at any point to change the value of
-- UseBootstrapPeers. Essentially the user can enable or disable bootstrap
-- peers at any time. Since 'monitorLedgerStateJudgement' will act on the
-- ledger state judgement value changing, this monitoring action should only
-- be responsible for either disabling bootstrap peers (in case the user
-- disables this flag) or enabling the 'monitorLedgerStateJudgement' action to
-- work correctly in the case the node finds itself in bootstrap mode. In
-- order to achieve this behavior, when bootstrap peers are disabled we should
-- update the ledger state judgement value to 'YoungEnough'; and
-- 'hasOnlyBootstrapPeers' to 'False'.
--
-- Here's a brief explanation why this works. There's 4 scenarios to consider:
--
-- 1. The node is in 'YoungEnough' state and the user
--  1.1. Enables bootstrap peers: In this case since the node is caught up
--  nothing should happen, so setting the LSJ to YoungEnough state is
--  idempotent.
--  1.2. Disables bootstrap peers: In this case, since the node is caught up,
--  its functioning can't really be distinguished from that of a node that has
--  bootstrap peers disabled. So changing the LSJ and 'hasOnlyBootstrapPeers'
--  flag is idempotent.
-- 2. The node is in 'TooOld' state and the user
--  2.1. Enables bootstrap peers: If the node is behind, enabling bootstrap
--  peers will enable 'monitorLedgerStateJudgement'. So if we set the LSJ to
--  be in 'YoungEnough' state it is going to make sure 'monitorLedgerStateJudgement'
--  observes the 'TooOld' state, triggering the right measures to be taken.
--  2.2. Disables bootstrap peers: If this is the case, we want to let the
--  peer connect to non-trusted peers, so just updating the boostrap peers
--  flag will enable the previously disabled monitoring actions.

-- | Monitor 'LedgerStateJudgement', if it changes,
--
-- For Praos mode:
-- If bootstrap peers are enabled, we need to update 'PeerSelectionTargets'.
-- If the ledger state changed to 'TooOld' we set all other targets to 0
-- and the governor waits for all active connections to drop and then set
-- the targets to sensible values for getting caught up again.
-- However if the state changes to 'YoungEnough' we reset the targets back to
-- their original values.
--
-- It should be noted if the node has bootstrap peers disabled then this
-- monitoring action will be disabled.
--
-- It should also be noted that churning is ignored until the node converges
-- to a clean state. I.e., it will disconnect from the targets source of truth.
