-- | In this test we have two candidates chains that are static throughout the
-- run. The two chains share some common prefix (genesis in the degenerate
-- case). The test runs the block fetch logic to download all of both chain
-- candidates.
--
-- In this variant we set up the common prefix of the two candidates as the
-- \"current\" chain. This means the block fetch only has to download the
-- suffixes of the two candidates. This also means that the two suffixes are
-- guaranteed not to have any overlap in their blocks. We rely on this
-- guarantee in this special case to check stronger properties.
--
-- This runs the block fetch and then checks that the trace of the events in
-- that run satisfy the trace properties:
--
-- * 'tracePropertyBlocksRequestedAndRecievedPerPeer'
-- * 'tracePropertyClientStateSanity'

-- | Check the execution trace for a particular property: we observe all the

-- requested and completed by both fetch clients is exactly the sequence
-- expected. The expected sequence is exactly the chain suffixes in order.
--
-- This property is stronger than 'tracePropertyBlocksRequestedAndRecievedAllPeers'
-- since it works with sequences rather than sets and for each chain
-- individually rather than both chains together. It only holds for the
-- situation where the suffixes of the chains that need to be fetched are
-- disjoint, sharing no common prefix.
--
-- It turns out that no duplicates part is not trivial. Earlier versions of the
-- block fetch logic did not satisfy this in all cases.
