--
-- QuickCheck properties
--

-- We start with basic properties in the style of "never does bad things"
-- and progress to properties that check that it "eventually does good things".
--
-- In the "never does bad things" category we have:
--
-- * A basic state space exploration property that checks we don't encounter
--   internal errors. This includes some limited checking that we get adequate
--   coverage of the different actions, by looking for coverage of all the
--   trace events. The coverage checks here are useful to give us confidence
--   about coverage for some of the other properties.
--
-- * A no-livelock property. This checks that the governor does not get stuck
--   doing too many steps at a single moment in (virtual) time. It's quite easy
--   to write bugs that don't cause the governor to fail, but cause it to go
--   into a busy cycle. See also the "no excessive busyness" property for a
--   more advanced version.
--
-- * A state consistency property that the governor's view of part of the state
--   and the "true" state of the mock environment are maintained in an
--   appropriate correspondence.
--
-- In the "eventually does good things" category we have:
--
-- * A basic property to check the governor does produce non-trivial traces.
--
-- * A cold peer gossip "reachable" property: that the governor either hits
--   its target for the number of cold peers, or finds all the reachable peers.
--
-- Properties that we would like to have:
--
-- * A "no excessive busyness" property. This checks that the governor does not
--   remain too busy for too long. It's quite easy to write bugs that don't
--   cause the governor to fail, but cause it to go into fairly-busy cycles.
--
-- * A public root peers target property: that the governor hits its target for
--   for the number of public root peers (or as near as possible), and does
--   note "grossly" overshoot. Since the public roots is a one sided target, but
--   we don't want to overshoot excessively.
--
-- * A warm peer target property: that the governor hits its established peers
--   target (or as near as possible).
--
-- * A hot peer target property: that the governor hits its active peers
--   target (or as near as possible).
--
-- * A local root peers target property: that the governor hits it target for
--   getting all its local root peers into the established state, and a target
--   number of them into the active state (or as near as possible).
--
-- Other properties we might like to think about
--
-- * for vaguely stable envs, we do stablise at our target number of cold peers
-- * time to stabilise after a change is not crazy
-- * time to find new nodes after a graph change is ok
-- * targets or root peer set dynamic


-- | As the most basic property we run the governor and check that it produces
-- any trace output at all. It should elicit some activity, unless the test
-- environment is actually empty.

-- | As a basic property we run the governor to explore its state space a bit
-- and check it does not throw any exceptions (assertions such as invariant
-- violations).
--
-- We do /not/ assume freedom from livelock for this property, so we run the
-- governor for a maximum number of trace events rather than for a fixed
-- simulated time.

-- | It is relatively easy to write bugs where the governor is stuck in a tight
-- cycle of continuous activity. Due to the way the I\/O simulator manages
-- virtual time, these bugs exhibits themselves by infinite trace activity
-- without time advancing.
--
-- It is important to catch these bugs early in the set of tests, since it is
-- hard to write many of the other more interesting properties if there are
-- these kinds of livelock bugs. Or to put it another way, the other properties
-- can be expressed more simply if they can assume within event traces that the
-- time always advances after some finite number of events.

-- | It is easy to get bugs where the governor is stuck in a cycle, working but
-- not making progress. This kind of bug would result in the governor thread
-- being excessively busy, so it might not be easily noticed.
--
-- This is more subtle and general than a simple livelock test that just checks
-- we don't get completely stuck. This property is about the possibility that
-- the governor is excessively busy over some period of time. This includes
-- "slow" livelocks where time advances during some of the steps in the cycle.
-- More interestingly this is also about a failure to converge and return to
-- being idle sufficiently quickly.
--
-- For example the governor could gets stuck in a cycle promoting and demoting
-- a peer once a second. In such a failure mode it will have a continuous level
-- of activity and will not return to being idle (perhaps ever or perhaps for
-- an extended period until some other environment perturbation gets us out of
-- the cycle).
--
-- The approach we take is based on the observation that the governor can
-- (quite reasonably) start with a big burst of activity (e.g. as it gossips
-- to discover a big graph) but that in the long term it settles down and only
-- has small bursts of activity in reaction to perturbations in the environment
-- such as failures or changes in targets.
--
-- The approach we take is to look at spans of busy activity followed by
-- periods of idleness. If the spans of busy activity are too long then we
-- fail. So this counts the time of busyness not the number of events. We
-- account for activity in the environment that the governor needs to respond
-- to by counting \"perturbation credits"\: more credits means we allow longer
-- spans of busyness.
--
-- More specifically: we look at runs of events where the time between events
-- is less than a threshold. This implies there follows a threshold level of
-- idleness. Starting or within that run of events there can be environment
-- events. These are the perturbations from the environment that we expect to
-- trigger a series of responses from the governor. So we expect longer periods
-- of business for bigger perturbations. We sum all the perturbations credits
-- included in a run of events. We use a formula that relates the credits to
-- the permitted time span of the run. If the run is within the permitted time
-- span then it is ok, otherwise it is a failure (and the run is the
-- counterexample).
--
-- TODO: This test uses static root peers, but we should move to dynamic root
-- peers.
