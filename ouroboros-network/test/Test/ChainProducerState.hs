prop_init_lookup :: ChainProducerStateTest -> Bool

-- | As above but check that when we move the reader on by one, from the
-- rollback state, they stay at the same point but are now in the forward state.
--
prop_init_next_lookup :: ChainProducerStateTest -> Bool
prop_init_next_lookup (ChainProducerStateTest c _ p) =

-- | Check that after moving the reader point that the reader is in the
-- expected state, at the right point and in the rollback state.
--
prop_update_lookup :: ChainProducerStateTest -> Bool
prop_update_lookup (ChainProducerStateTest c rid p) =
    let c' = updateReader rid p c in

-- | This says that if we take a chain producer and apply a bunch of updates
-- and initialise a consumer to the producer's initial chain, then by
-- applying update instructions from the producer to the consumer then the
-- consumer ends up in the same final state.
--
-- The limitation of this test is that it applies all the updates to the
-- producer first and then syncronises without changing the producer.
