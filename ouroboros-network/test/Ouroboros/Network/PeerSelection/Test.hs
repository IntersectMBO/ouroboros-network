-- QuickCheck properties
--

-- Things we might like to test...
--
-- * for even insane environments, there is no insane behaviour
--   trace properties:
--   * progress: all actions should make monotonic progress
--   * no busy work: limit on number of governor iterations before time advances
--   * trace sanity: model of state can be reconstructed from trace events
--
-- * for vaguely stable envs, we do stablise at our target number of cold peers
-- * we stabilise without going insane even if the available nodes are fewer than the target
-- * time to stabilise after a change is not crazy
-- * time to find new nodes after a graph change is ok
-- * targets or root peer set dynamic
-- * check local root peers are what we expect
-- * check governor view of connection status does not lag reality too much


-- | Run the governor for up to 24 hours (simulated obviously) and see if it

-- | It is easy to get bugs where the governor is stuck in a busy loop working
-- but not making progress. This kind of bug would result in the governor
-- thread consuming all the cpu, but wouldn't actually stop the node, so might

--
-- We check for this condition by requiring that trace events a certain number
-- of events apart are sufficiently far apart in time too. This will be
-- violated if the governor starts making very slow forward progress.
