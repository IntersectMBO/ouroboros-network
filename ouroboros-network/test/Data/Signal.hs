-- Time stamps and events
--

-- The instance Applicative Signal relies on merging event streams.
-- The IO simulator's treatment of time means that we can have many
-- events that occur at the same virtual time, though they are stil
-- causually ordered.
--
-- We need these compound time stamps to be able to resolve the order
-- of the events that have the same Time when merging event streams.
-- The compound time stamp records the event number from the original
-- trace, for events derivied from the original trace. For artificially
-- constructed events, they can use small or big counters to be ordered
-- before or after other events at the same time. Negative counters are
-- permitted for this purpose.
