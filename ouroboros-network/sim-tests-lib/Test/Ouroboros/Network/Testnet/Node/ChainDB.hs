-- | ChainDB is an in memory store of all fetched (downloaded) blocks.
--
-- This type holds an index mapping previous hashes to their blocks (i.e. if a
-- block "A" has prevHash "H" then the entry "H -> [A]" exists in the map) and
-- the current version of the longest chain.
--
-- Used to simulate real world ChainDB, it offers the invariant that
-- 'cdbLongestChainVar' is always the longest known chain of downloaded blocks.
-- Whenever a node generates a new block it gets added here, and whenever it gets
-- a block via block fetch it gets added here as well. Everytime 'addBlock' is
-- called the possibly new longest chain gets computed, since the API is atomic
-- we can guarantee that in each moment ChainDB has the current longest chain.
--
-- This type is used in diffusion simulation.
