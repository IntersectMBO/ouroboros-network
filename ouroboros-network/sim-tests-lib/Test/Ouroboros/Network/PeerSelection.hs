-- We start with basic properties in the style of "never does bad things"
-- and progress to properties that check that it "eventually does good things".
--
-- In the "never does bad things" category we have:
--
-- * A basic state space exploration property that checks we don't encounter
--   internal errors. This includes some limited checking that we get adequate
--   coverage of the different actions, by looking for coverage of all the
--   trace events. The coverage checks here are useful to give us confidence
--   about coverage for some of the other properties.
--
-- * A no-livelock property. This checks that the governor does not get stuck
--   doing too many steps at a single moment in (virtual) time. It's quite easy
--   to write bugs that don't cause the governor to fail, but cause it to go
--   into a busy cycle. See also the "no excessive busyness" property for a
--   more advanced version.
--
-- * A "no excessive busyness" property. This checks that the governor does not
--   remain too busy for too long. It's quite easy to write bugs that don't
--   cause the governor to fail, but cause it to go into fairly-busy cycles.
--
-- * A state consistency property that the governor's view of part of the state
--   and the "true" state of the mock environment are maintained in an
--   appropriate correspondence.
--
-- In the "eventually does good things" category we have:
--
-- * A basic property to check the governor does produce non-trivial traces.
--
-- * A cold peer peer sharing "reachable" property: that the governor either hits
--   its target for the number of cold peers, or finds all the reachable peers.
--
-- * A known peer target progress property: that the governor makes progress
--   within a bounded time towards its known peers target, from below and above.
--
-- * An established peer target property: the same as above but for established
--   peers.
--
-- * An active peer target property: the same as above but for active peers.
--
-- Properties that we would like to have:
--
-- * A public root peers target property: that the governor hits its target for
--   for the number of public root peers (or as near as possible), and does
--   not "grossly" overshoot. Since the public roots is a one sided target, but
--   we don't want to overshoot excessively.
--
-- * A local root peers target property: that the governor hits its target for
--   getting all its local root peers into the established state, and a target
--   number of them into the active state (or as near as possible).
--
-- Other properties we might like to think about
--
-- * time to find new nodes after a graph change is ok
-- * targets or root peer set dynamic


-- | As the most basic property we run the governor and check that it produces
-- any trace output at all. It should elicit some activity, unless the test
-- environment is actually empty.

-- | It is easy to get bugs where the governor is stuck in a cycle, working but
-- not making progress. This kind of bug would result in the governor thread
-- being excessively busy, so it might not be easily noticed.
--
-- This is more subtle and general than a simple livelock test that just checks
-- we don't get completely stuck. This property is about the possibility that
-- the governor is excessively busy over some period of time. This includes
-- "slow" livelocks where time advances during some of the steps in the cycle.
-- More interestingly this is also about a failure to converge and return to
-- being idle sufficiently quickly.
--
-- For example the governor could gets stuck in a cycle promoting and demoting
-- a peer once a second. In such a failure mode it will have a continuous level
-- of activity and will not return to being idle (perhaps ever or perhaps for
-- an extended period until some other environment perturbation gets us out of
-- the cycle).
--
-- The approach we take is based on the observation that the governor can
-- (quite reasonably) start with a big burst of activity (e.g. as it peer shares
-- to discover a big graph) but that in the long term it settles down and only
-- has small bursts of activity in reaction to perturbations in the environment
-- such as failures or changes in targets.
--
-- The approach we take is to look at spans of busy activity followed by
-- periods of idleness. If the spans of busy activity are too long then we
-- fail. So this counts the time of busyness not the number of events. We
-- account for activity in the environment that the governor needs to respond
-- to by counting \"perturbation credits"\: more credits means we allow longer
-- spans of busyness.
--
-- More specifically: we look at runs of events where the time between events
-- is less than a threshold. This implies there follows a threshold level of
-- idleness. Starting or within that run of events there can be environment
-- events. These are the perturbations from the environment that we expect to
-- trigger a series of responses from the governor. So we expect longer periods
-- of business for bigger perturbations. We sum all the perturbations credits
-- included in a run of events. We use a formula that relates the credits to
-- the permitted time span of the run. If the run is within the permitted time
-- span then it is ok, otherwise it is a failure (and the run is the
-- counterexample).
--
-- TODO: This test uses static root peers, but we should move to dynamic root
-- peers.

-- | The main progress property for known peers: that we make progress towards
-- the target for known peers from below. See 'prop_governor_target_known_above'
-- for the (simpler) corresponding property for hitting the target from above.
--
-- Intuitively the property we want is that the governor either hits its target
-- for the number of known peers, or gets as close as reasonably possible. The
-- environment may be such that it prevents the governor from reaching its
-- target, e.g. because the target is too high, or not all peers may be
-- reachable by the peer share graph.
--
-- We approach this property as the conjunction of several simpler properties.
-- We take this approach for three main reasons.
--
-- 1. Firstly modularity help us break down a complex problem into simpler
--    problems. Overall this progress idea turns out to be quite subtle and
--    tricky to express precisely in a way that actually works.
-- 2. Secondly, modularity can give us opportunities to reuse code in other
--    properties and we want to have progress properties for all the governor
--    targets.
-- 3. Thirdly, it turns out to be hard to dictate in a universal way precisely
--    what the governor can be expected to do. It is simpler to specify looser
--    constraints on what it must and must not do. We can then argue informally
--    that the combination of properties must lead to the kinds of outcomes we
--    intend.
--
-- We decompose the progress property into the following (informally stated)
-- properties:
--
-- 1. The set of peers the governor knows about is a subset of the peers the
--    environment has told the governor about.
--
--    This is a weak property since it simply says that the governor does not
--    invent things out of thin air. We might expect that we could strengthen
--    this property to require that the subset be maximal in some sense however
--    such a property is violated by dynamic targets. There are also timing
--    issues which would complicate such a strengthened property: the governor
--    has legitimate reasons to update its internal state some time after the
--    environment informs it about new peers.
--
-- 2. If the governor is below target and has the opportunity to peer share then
--    within a bounded time it should perform a share request with one of its
--    established peers.
--
--    This is the primary progress property. It is a relatively weak property:
--    we do not require that progress is actually made, just that opportunities
--    for progress are taken when available. We cannot always demand actual
--    progress since there are environments where it is not possible to make
--    progress, even though opportunities for peer sharing remain available.
--    Examples include environments where the total set of peers in the graph
--    is less than the target for known peers.
--
-- 3. The governor should not peer share too frequently with any individual peer,
--    except when the governor forgets known peers.
--
--    This is both useful in its own right, but it also helps to strengthen the
--    primary property by helping to ensure that the choices of which peers to
--    ask to are reasonable. In the primary property we do not require that
--    the peer the governor chooses to peer share with is one of the opportunities
--    as defined by the property. We do not require this because the set of
--    opportunities is a lower bound not an upper bound, and trying to make it a
--    tight bound becomes complex and over-specifies behaviour.
--    There is the danger however that the governor could appear to try to make
--    progress by peer sharing but always picking useless choices that avoid
--    making actual progress. By requiring that the governor not peer share with
--    any individual peer too often we can shrink the set of peers the governor can
--    choose and thus force the governor to eventually pick other peers to
--    peer share with, which should mean the governor eventually picks peers that
--    can enable progress.
--
-- 4. When the governor does perform a peer sharing request, within a bounded
--    time it should include the results into its known peer set, or the known
--    peer set should reach its target size.
--
--    This helps to strengthen the primary progress property by ensuring the
--    results of peer sharing are used to make progress when that is possible.
--
-- 5. The governor should not shrink its known peer set except when it is above
--    the target size.
--
--    This also helps to strengthen the second property by ensuring monotonic
--    progress, except when we overshoot targets or when targets are reduced.
--
-- The overall progress argument is then an semi-formal argument, structured
-- much like classic proofs about loops. A classic loop proof has two parts: 1.
-- if the loop does terminate it gets the right result, and 2. it must
-- eventually terminate because it makes progress in some measure that is
-- bounded.
--
-- Of course in our setting there is no termination, but we can reach a goal
-- and remain in a steady state until the environment changes. Our argument is
-- that the governor makes progress to increase the size of its set of known
-- peers until either it hits its target number of known peers, or it reaches a
-- maximal possible set. As a corollary if the targets do not change too
-- frequently then it will eventually hit the target or reach a maximal set.
--
-- Property number 1 above tells us that if we do reach our goal condition that
-- we will have a correct result, as property 1 tells us that all the governors'
-- known peers are ones supplied by the environment.
--
-- Progress from below relies on the combination of property 2, 3, 4 and 5.
-- Property 2 tells us that we eventually peer share with some peer, but
-- does not by itself establish that we make progress in a bounded measure.
-- Property 3 gives us the bounded measure. Property 3 gives us a set of peers
-- that we have not peer shared with recently. When the governor does peer share
-- with a peer then it is removed from this set (but scheduled to be added back
-- some time later). So the measure is the size of this set of peers. It is
-- clearly bounded below by the empty set. So the combination of 2 and 3 tells
-- us we make progress in this bounded measure, but that does not directly
-- translate into increasing the size of the known peers set. Properties 4 and 5
-- tell us that progress with peer sharing will eventually translate into
-- increasing the size of the known peers set if that is possible.
--
-- There is one known wrinkle to this argument to do with property 3 that when
-- the governor peer shares with a peer it is removed from the tracking set
-- however it gets added back some time later. If they get added back too soon
-- then it would undermine the progress argument because it would break the
-- argument about decreasing the bounded measure. This is readily solved
-- however: we simply need to make sure the time scale for peer sharing
-- frequency is relatively long, and the other progress bounds are relatively
-- short.

-- | Check that the governor can hit (but not overshoot) its target for the
-- number of warm peers. This has to be bounded by what is possible: we cannot
-- always find enough peers, and when we can, some of them fail.
--
-- This is a somewhat tricky property to express because it is non-trivial to
-- find the maximum number of possible established connections by inspecting
-- the mock environment.
--
-- We approach it in three parts: from above, from below and statistically.
--
-- The simplest is from above: the environment knows how many established
-- connections there are at any point in (virtual) time, and what the targets
-- are. So we can easily compare the two. This can be a tight bound above.
-- When the target is stable, the governor should never overshoot the target.
-- When the target changes to be smaller, the governor should shrink the number
-- of established connections to be within the target within a relatively short
-- period of time.
--
--
--
-- Tracking very precisely the maximum number of peers we could reasonably
-- establish connections to is tricky and hence prone to mistakes in the test
-- definition. So as an extra sanity check we take a simpler but fuzzy approach.
-- In some fraction of test runs, the environment should be such that it is
-- possible to actually hit the target for the number of established peers. So
-- we label the cases where this happens, and then we can use a statistical
-- test to assert that this happens in some fraction of test cases.
