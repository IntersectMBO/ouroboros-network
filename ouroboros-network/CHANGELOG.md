- In `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion` changes to `ExtraTracers`,
  `ArgumentsExtra`, `Applications` `ApplicationsExtra` were made to include
  all required extension point type variables. `run` function now is 100%
  polymorphic and independent of Cardano specifics.
- Moved most common Diffusion data types definitions (e.g. `ArgumentsExtra`,
  `ApplicationsExtra`, `NodeToNodeConnectionManager`, etc.) to
  `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion.Common`. These data types were also changed to
  include the necessary extension points to make them general and polymorphic
  regarding Cardano specific details.
  - `Applications` now has `extraAPI` type parameter used by `laLedgerPeersCtx`
  - `TracersExtra` now has `extraState`, `extraDebugState`, `extraFlags`,
    `extraPeers`, `extraCounters` type parameters
  - `ArgumentsExtra` now has `extraArgs`, `extraState`, `extraDebugState`,
    `extraActions`, `extraFlags`, `extraPeers`, `extraAPI`, `extraChurnArgs`,
    `extraCounters` type parameters.
    - This data type also now includes:
      - `daPeerSelectionGovernorArgs` to enable users to provide their own
        churn governor.
      - `daPeerSelectionStateToExtraCounters` to enable users to provider
      their own `extraCounters` counter function.
      - `daToExtraPeers` to enable users to provide how to construct
      their own `extraPeers` from a DNS lookup result.
      - `daRequestPublicRootPeers` to enable users to provide how to fetch
      their own public root peers. Note that if no custom function is required
      a default one is provided.
      - `daPeerChurnGovernor` to enable users to provide their own churn
      governor. Note that if no custom function is required a default one is
      provided.
      - `daExtraActions` field to enable users to provide their own
        `extraActions`
      - `daExtraChurnArgs` field to enable users to provide their own
        `extraChurnArgs`
      - `daExtraArgs` field to enable users to provide their own `extraArgs`
  - `Interfaces` now has `extraState`, `extraFlags`, `extraPeers`, `extraAPI`
    type parameters.
    - This data type also now includes:
      - `diInstallSigUSR1Handler` field to enable users to provide their own
        SIG USR1 signal handler.
- `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion.P2P` `runM` and `run` is now fully polymorphic over
  Cardano specific details. It uses default implementations for
  `requestPublicRootPeers` if none is provided
- `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion.Policies` now only contains a simple peer
  selection policy used by a default churn governor implementation that does
  not depend on Cardano specifics.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Churn` `PeerChurnArgs` now has `extraArgs`,
  `extraDebugState`, `extraFlags`, `extraPeers`, `extraAPI`, `extraCounters`
  type parameters.
  - This data type also now includes:
    - `getOriginalPeerTargets` which returns the local configured
      `PeerSelectionTargets`
  - `peerChurnGovernor` is now polymorphic and simpler since it does not
  depend on Cardano specifics. This function is should be used as the default
  one if no custom churn governor is provided.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor` `peerSelectionGovernor` is now
  fully polymorphic and does not depend on Cardano specifics. It relies on
  `PeerSelectionGovernorArgs`'s `ExtraGuardedDecisions` data type to insert
  the extra monitoring actions that an user might configure.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor.{Monitor, ActivePeers, BigLedgerPeers, EstablishedPeers, KnownPeers, RootPeers}`
  monitoring actions functions were made fully polymorphic.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor.Types` `PeerSelectionActions` now
  has `extraState`, `extraActions`, `extraFlags`, `extraPeers`, `extraAPI`,
  `extraCounters`.
  - This data type also now includes:
    - `readLocalRootPeersFromFile` for reading the original set of locally
      configured root peers.
    - `extraPeersAPI` field for accessing the `PublicExtraPeersAPI` data type.
    - `extraStateToExtraCounters` to compute `extraCounters` from `PeerSelectionState`
    - `updateOutboundConnectionsState` was *removed* and moved elsewhere since
    it was a Cardano specific function.
    - `extraActions` field to enable users to provide their own
      `extraActions`.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor.Types` `PeerSelectionInterfaces` now
  has `extraState`, `extraFlags`, `extraPeers`, `extraCounters`.
- Created `PeerSelectionGovernorArgs` which contains `ExtraGuardedDecisions`
  in `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor.Types` to enable users to
  extend the peer selection governor monitoring actions and a few other bits
  like when to abort the governor.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor.Types` `PeerSelectionState` now
  has `extraState`, `extraFlags`, `extraPeers`.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor.Types` `DebugPeerSelectionState` now
  has `extraState`, `extraFlags`, `extraPeers`.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor.Types` `PeerSelectionView` now
  has `extraViews`.
- `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.LedgerPeers` `ledgerPeersThread`,
  `withLedgerPeers` and `WithLedgerPeersArgs` have too been refactored to
  accommodate the required extra type parameters.
- Removed `LedgerStateJudgement` from `LedgerPeers` data type in
  `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.LedgerPeers.Common`
- `withPeerSelectionActions` no longer receives `PeerSelectionActionsArgs` as
  this data type was redundant. Instead a callback that creates
  `PeerSelectionActions` is passed and used.

  In the same module (`Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.PeerSelectionActions`)
  a default, polymorphic implementation for `requestPublicRootPeers` is
  provided.
- `PublicRootPeers` data type in `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.PublicRootPeers`
  no longer uses Cardano specific notions such as bootstrap peers. It now
  abstracts over them using the `extraPeers` type parameter. All the functions
  were refactored to accommodate this change. Now each function receives a
  callback that is applied to the `extraPeers` field. To make this more
  ergonomic the `PublicExtraPeersAPI` data type was created in
  `Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Types`, which is a record of all
  `PublicRootPeers` manipulation functions.
- Removed `paDNSSemaphore` from `PeerActionsDNS`, this is now passed to
  `WithLedgerPeersArgs`.
- `TraceLocalRootPeers` now has `extraFlags` type parameters.
- `localRootPeersProvider` now receives `PeerActionsDNS` instead of the
  `toPeerAddr` callback.
- `LocalRootConfig` now has `extraFlags` type parameter and field
  (`PeerTrustable` was abstracted out, since this was a bootstrap peers
  Cardano specific type.).
- `LocalRootPeers` now has `extraFlags` type parameter.

### Non-breaking changes

## 0.19.0.2 -- 2025-02-03

### Non-breaking changes

* UnknownMiniProtocol error should not crash the node

## 0.19.0.1 -- 2025-01-15

### Non-breaking changes

- Removed `UnsupportedOperation` from rethrow policy.

## 0.19.0.0 -- 2025-01-02

### Breaking changes

* Added `AcquireConnectionError` to `PeerSelectionActionsTrace`
* Removed deprecated `ReconnectDelay` type alias.
* Addapted to `network-mux` changes in https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/pull/4999
* Addapted to `network-mux` changes in https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network/pull/4997
* Use `LocalRootConfig` instead of a tuple.
* Extended `LocalRootConfig` with `diffusionMode :: DiffusionMode` field.
* Added `diConnStateSupply` record field to `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion.P2P.Interfaces`.
* UnknownMiniProtocol error should not crash the node

### Non-breaking changes

* Added the `mapTraceFetchClientState` function

## 0.18.0.0 -- 2024-10-17

### Breaking changes

* Introduced `daReadLedgerPeerSnapshot` to `P2P.ArgumentsExtra` which holds
  a `Maybe LedgerPeerSnapshot` from a node's configuration. If present, it
  may be used to pick big ledger peers by the peer selection governor when
  bootstrapping a node in Genesis consensus mode, or in general when
  LedgerStateJudgement = TooOld, subject to conditions in
  `LedgerPeers.ledgerPeersThread`.
* Diffusion run function in P2P mode has new paramaters:
    * `daPeerTargets` - replaces daPeerSelectionTargets. `Configuration`
        module provides an API. Used by peer selection & churn governors. Given
        required arguments, it returns the correct target basis to use for churn
        and peer selection governors.
    * `daConsensusMode` - flag indicating whether diffusion should run in Praos
      or Genesis mode, which influences what `PeerSelectionTargets` both
      governors should use. Genesis may use two different sets of targets
      depending on ledger state, while Praos uses only one set. Either set
      once active is appropriately churned.
* Added `daMinBigLedgerPeersForTrustedState` to `ArgumentsExtra` when starting diffusion.
  It is used by `outboundConnectionsState` when signaling trust state when syncing in
  Genesis mode. Default value is provided by the Configuration module.
* Using `typed-protocols-0.3.0.0`.
* `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToClient.connectTo` takes
  `OuroborosApplicationWithMinimalCtx` which is using `Void` type for responder
  protocols.  It anyway only accepts `InitiatorMode`, and thus no responder
  protocols can be specified, nontheless this might require changing type
  signature of the applications passed to it.  `connectTo` returns now either
  an error or the result of the first terminated mini-protocol.
* `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToNode.connectTo` returns either an error or the
  result of the first terminated mini-protocol.
* Adjusted for changes in `ouroboros-network-framework` (PR #4990)
* Renamed `blockForgeUTCTime` to `headerForgeUTCTime` in `FetchClientPolicy`.

### Non-Breaking changes

* Implemented provision of big ledger peers from the snapshot by `ledgerPeersThread`
* Added property test checking if `ledgerPeersThread` is providing big ledger peers
  from the snapshot when appropriate conditions are met
* Added property tests checking if `LedgerPeerSnapshot` CBOR encoding is valid,
  and decode/encode = id, as well as some property tests for calculating big ledger
  peers
* Implemented separate configurable peer selection targets for Praos and
  Genesis consensus modes. Genesis mode may use more big ledger peers when
  a node is syncing up.
* Implemented verification of big ledger peer snapshot when syncing reaches
  the point at which the snapshot was taken. An error is raised when there's
  a mismatch detected.
* Added `defaultDeadlineChurnInterval` and `defaultBulkChurnInterval` to Configuration
  module. Previously these were hard coded in node.
* Updated tests for `network-mux` changes.
* Dropped all node-to-client versions < `NodeToClientV_16`.

## 0.16.0.0 -- 2024-05-07

### Breaking changes

* Added `daUpdateOutboundConnectionsState :: OutboundConnectionsState -> STM m ()`
  to `Diffusion.Common.Applications`. This callback is to be provided by
  consensus and is propagated all the way to the peer selection governor.

## 0.15.0.0 -- 2024-05-07

### Breaking changes

* Added `dtTraceChurnCounters` to `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion.P2P.TracersExtra`.
* Added `PeerSelectionView` and `PeerSelectionCounters` (now a pattern synonym)
  which provides sets or sizes of active / established / known sets, and added
  `PeerSelectionCountersHWC` which provides sizes of hot / warm / cold sets.
  The counters cover more groups including: all peers, big ledger peers,
  bootstrap peers, local roots and shared peers.
* `emptyPeerSelectionState` doesn't take targets of local roots.
* Added `AssociationMode` and `LedgerStateJudgement` to `DebugPeerSelectionState`.
  Both should be exposed through `EKG` counters by the node.
* Removed `TraceKnownInboundConnection` and replaced it with
  `TracePickInboundPeers` message in the peer selection tracer.
* Adapted to changes in `ouroboros-network-framework`, in particular the
  outbound governor is using `PublicInboundGovernorState` to implemented light
  peer sharing.

### Non-Breaking changes

* Improved Churn governor by synchronizing according to the counters instead
  of relying on `threadDelay`.

### Breaking changes

* `newPeerSharingAPI` requires `PublicPeerSelectionState` variable to be passed to it.
* `Diffusion.Arguments` requires `PublicPeerSelectionState`; the integration
  code should make sure both `newPeerSharingAPI` and diffusion receives the
  same mutable variable.
* `TracePeerShareRequest` also includes the number of requests peers.

## 0.13.1.0 -- 2024-03-20

### Non-Breaking changes

* Increase timeout to 120s for 'any Cold async demotion' test

## 0.13.0.0 -- 2024-03-14

### Breaking changes

### Non-Breaking changes

* Fix `LedgerStateJudgement` redundant tracing
* Refactored `computePeerSharingPeers` and moved it to
  `Ouroboros.Network.Peersharing`
* Fix 'any Cold async demotion' test
* Let light peer sharing depend on the configured peer sharing flag
* Split churning of non-active peers into an established step and a known step.

## 0.11.0.0 -- 2024-01-22

### Breaking changes

  demotion to `cold` as well as `warm` state.  A `ReconnectDelay` type alias is
  still provided but deprecated.

* Changed pipelining parameters in `MiniProtocolParameters` from `Word32` to
  `Word16` to match the types elsewhere.

### Non-breaking changes

* The internal `Guarded` type changed.  It is provided with pattern synonyms
  which hide both `Min` and `FirstToFinish`.

* ghc-9.8 support.


## 0.10.2.1 -- 2023-12-14

This release is based directly on top of `ouroboros-network-0.10.1.0`.

### Non-breaking changes

* Fixed a bug in `outbound-governor`: PR #4748.  In rare cases the Outbound
  Governor could lose track of a connection, and thus not being able to
  reconnect to a remote peer.

## 0.10.2.0 -- 2023-12-14

Deprecated release.

### Non-breaking changes

* Fixed a bug in `outbound-governor`: PR #4748.  In rare cases the Outbound
  Governor could lose track of a connection, and thus not being able to
  reconnect to a remote peer.

## 0.10.1.0 -- 2023-11-29

### Non-breaking changes

* Fix random selection of peers to peer share with.
* Fix asynchronous demotions to `Cold` (`CoolingToCold`) not being noticed, hence
  making peers stay in the `inProgressDemotedToCold` set forever.
* Fixed bug where peers with `DoNotAdvertisePeer` flag were being shared
* Fixed peer sharing pool of peers to be shared being confused with the pool
  of peers to request to.

## 0.10.0.1 -- 2023-11-16

### Non-breaking changes

* Use `io-sim-1.3.0.0`.

## 0.10.0.0 -- 2023-11-02

### Breaking changes

* Make chainsync idle timeout configurable.

### Non-breaking changes

* Updated types to accommodate `PeerSharing` data type changes.
* Fixed PeerSharing IPv6 enc/decoding
* Introduce NodeToNodeVersion 13
* Updated types to accommodate `PeerSharing` data type changes:
  * `PeerSharingPrivate` got removed and hence, handshake is now symmetric,
  fixing issue [#4642](https://github.com/intersectmbo/ouroboros-network/issues/4642)
  * This implies that newer peer sharing node versions will see older
  version's `PeerSharingPrivate` as `PeerSharingEnabled`. So older version
  node's should not rely on `PeerSharingPrivate` semantics from newer version
  honest nodes.

* Changed encoding of IPv6 addresses sent over `PeerSharing` mini-protocol.

## 0.9.2.0 -- 2023-10-26

### Breaking changes

* Refactors `PeerSelection.RootPeersDNS` module, enabling more sharing between
  modules and providing just better module organisation overall.
    * Tweaks exports and imports
    * Shares semaphores with `withPeerSelectionActions` and `ledgerPeersThread`

### Non-breaking changes

* Updated KeepAlive client to collect a rtt sample for the first packet.
* Less aggresive churning of established and known peers.
* Added peer sharing to wireshark dissector.
* Added ledger peers to diffusion simulation
* Fixed diffusion tests.
* `demo-chain-sync`: added option parser, added new options.
* Lifted `chainGenerator` to be `Infinite`.
* Strengthened precondition in `pickPeers` to check that the peers to be picked
  from are a subset of the `PeerSelectionState` used to analyze them.
  - This is non-breaking because it reflects the current reality of how peers
    are chosen from `PeerSelectionState`.
* Restructured `txSubmissionOutbound` to prevent an impossible case and
  eliminate the associated error.

* Increase keyed timeout on a testnet test that was failing.

* Adds new constructor to `PeerStatus`: `PeerCooling`. This is in order to
  fix a possible race where a node would be asynchronously demoted to cold
  state, put into the cold set and wrongly forgotten, while its connection
  was not yet cleaned up. This could lead to the peer being added to the known
  set and promoted leading to a `TrConnectionExists` trace in the logs, which
  is disallowed. With this being said, `PeerCold` status is now an
  intermediate status that means the peer is cold but its connection still
  lingers. This extra information warns the governor not to move the peer to
  the cold set just yet.

  Yes it can mean that the governor could promote the peer to hot, however it
  will promptly fail since no mux will be running anyway.

## 0.9.1.0 -- 2023-08-22

### Breaking changes

* Removes `updatePeerSharing` from `KnownPeers` module API

### Non-breaking changes

* Disable light peer sharing if peer sharing is not enabled.
* Do not use light peer sharing in `node-to-client` case (which leads to a memory leak).
* Split `test` component into `io-tests` and `sim-tests`.


## 0.9.0.0 -- 2023-08-09

### Breaking changes

* The counters logged by `PeerSelectionCounters` for local root peers are now
  the number of warm and hot peers per group (before the first one was the
  target of the given group).

* Introduced big ledger peers to the outbound governor.  The breaking changes include:
  - Added new targets to `PeerSelectionTargets` data type

  - Added `requestBigLedgerPeers` to `PeerSelectionActions`.

  - `establishPeerConnection` and `ativatePeerConnection` receive an
    `IsLedgerPeer` argument (which is then passed to mini-protocols via
    `ExtendedInitiatorContext`.

  - The `PeerSelectionState` contains new fields to support big ledger peers.

  - Modified `PickPolicy` type, it is now parametrised by monad `m` rather than
    by an `stm` monad.  With this change the type alias can be used in
   `pickPeers` type signature.

  - `TraceLedgerPeers` renamed some constructors:
      - `PickedPeer  -> PickedLedgerPeer`
      - `PickedPeers -> PickedLedgerPeers`;
    added new ones:
      - `PickedBigLedgerPeer`
      - `PickedBigLedgerPeers`;
    and `FetchingNewLedgerState` constructor has a new field: number of big
    ledger peers.

* Propagated changes from `ouroboros-network-framework` related to the
  introduction of initiator and responder contexts to `RunMiniProtocol` data
  type. These changes include breaking changes to the following APIs:

  - `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion` is using: `OuroborosBundleWithExpandedCtx`
    for node-to-node applications, `OuroborosApplicationWithMinimalCtx` for
    node-to-client responders.
  - `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToNode` exports `MinimalInitiatorContext` and
    `ExpandedInitiatorContext` data types.
  - `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToClient` exports `MinimalInitiatorContext` and
    `ResponderContext` data types.
  - `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToNode.NodeToNodeProtocols`,
    `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToNode.nodeToNodeProtocols`,
    `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToNode.versionedNodeToClientProtocols`,
    `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToNode.withServer`  were modified.
  - `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToClient.NodeToClientProtocols`,
    `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToClient.nodeToClientProtocols`,
    `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToClient.versionedNodeToClientProtocols`,
    `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToClient.withServer`,
    `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToClient.ipSubscriptionWorker`,
    `Ouroboros.Network.NodeToClient.dnsSubscriptionWorker` were modified.

### Non-breaking changes

* Fixed a small memory leak in `PeerMetrics` (#4633).

* The counters logged by `PeerSelectionCounters` for local root peers are now
  the number of warm and hot peers per group (before the first one was the
  target of the given group).
* Added `getNumberOfPeers` destructor of `NumberOfPeers`.
* Added `NotEnoughBigLedgerPeers` and `NotEnoughLedgerPeers` constructors of
  `TraceLedgerPeers`; Renamed `FallingBackToBootstrapPeers` as
  `FallingBackToPublicRootPeers`.

## 0.8.2.0

### Breaking changes

* light peer sharing
  * Added `TraceKnownInboundConnection` constructor to `TracePeerSelection`
  * Added `readNewInboundConnection` field to `PeerSelectionActions` record.
* The constructor `FetchDeclineChainNoIntersection` was renamed to
  `FetchDeclineChainIntersectionTooDeep` (#4541)
* Include Warm Valency for Local Root Peers
* `TraceLedgerPeers` renamed some constructors:
    - `PickedPeer  -> PickedLedgerPeer`
    - `PickedPeers -> PickedLedgerPeers`;
  added new ones:
    - `PickedBigLedgerPeer`
    - `PickedBigLedgerPeers`;
  and `FetchingNewLedgerState` constructor has a new field: number of big
  ledger peers.

### Non-breaking changes

* Support for decoding Handshake Query Reply in wireshark dissector.
* Support for decoding CBOR payload in wireshark dissector.
* Limit concurrency used by dns resolution.  We only resolve up to 8 dns names
  concurrently for public / ledger peers and up to 2 for local root peers.
  This will affect how quickly node connects to ledger peers when it starts.
* Improved memory footprint of peer metrics (#4620)

## 0.8.1.1

### Non-breaking changes

* Initialise local root peers results `TVar` (#4584).

## 0.8.1.0

### Non-breaking changes

* Do not wrap `ExitCode` in `DiffusionError` wrapper.

## 0.8.0.1

### Non-breaking changes

* Export `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion.Failiure` constructors.

## 0.8.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Changed how DNS for local root peers works
  - Change TraceLocalRootPeersTrace to include TraceLocalRootDNSMap constructor;
  - Change TraceLocalRootGroups constructor type;
  - Change localRootPeersProvider type signature;
  - Updated tests to reflect the above changes.

## 0.7.0.1

### Non-breaking changes

* Updated to use `ouroboros-network-api-0.5.0.0`.

## 0.7.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Added `DiffusionError` constructor of `Ouroboros.Network.Diffusion.Failure` which kind is now `Type`.

### Non-breaking changes

* Compatible with `ouroboros-network-framework-0.6.0.0` and
  `ouroboros-network-api-0.4.0.0`

## 0.6.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Use `io-classes-1.1`.

### Non-breaking changes

* `ghc-9.4` and `ghc-9.6` compatiblity.

## 0.5.0.0 -- 2023-04-19

### Breaking

- Integration of latest `cardano-ledger` and `cardano-base`.

- Add Peer Sharing feature:

  Peer Sharing is a new miniprotocol where nodes can share peer addresses, in order to
  discover new peers. It is only used if enabled. It should be disabled by default. Please
  read this design plan to understand the rationale and how Peer Sharing works with more
  detail:
  https://github.com/intersectmbo/ouroboros-network/wiki/Peer-Sharing-Implementation-Plan

  This new feature includes the following changes:

  - Peer Sharing - MiniProtocol
  - Refactor KnownPeers and EstablishedPeers
  - Refactor old "gossip" Peer Selection mechanism.
  - Changes to Handshake
    - Add new NodeToNode version
    - Add PeerSharing to RunNodeArgs and NodeToNodeVersionData
    - Add versionData (agreedOptions) to ConnectionHandler
    - Add versionData to PeerConnectionHandle
    - New CDDL tests

### Non-breaking

- Fix interop problems between NonP2P and P2P nodes (PR #4465)
- Refactors requestPublicRootPeers to include PeerAdvertise
  - Public Roots Peer Advertise value is now used
- Implement ChainDB to fix header-body split in Diffusion Tests
- Fix DNS issue #4491

## 0.4.0.1 -- 2023-02-24

### Non-breaking

* Fixed bugs in peer state actions & testing framework (PR #4385)

## 0.4.0.0 -- 2023-01-25

* Packages where reorganised:
   * `ouroboros-network-api`: a common api for `network` & `consensus` packages
   * `ouroboros-network-mock`: a mock chain which is used for testing purposes
   * `ouroboros-network-protocols`: implementation & tests of all mini-protocols.
      It contains two public libraries:
         * `ouroboros-network-protocols`
         * `ouroboros-network-protocols:testlib`
* Moved the `ipv6` cabal flag to `ouroboros-network-framework` package.
* Build with `ghc-9.2`.

## 0.3.0.2

### Non-breaking changes

- Fix interop problems between NonP2P and P2P nodes (PR #4465)

## 0.3.0.0 -- YYYY-MM-DD

*

## 0.2.0.0 -- YYYY-MM-DD
