-- | This class is for abstracting over 'stToIO' which allows running 'ST'
-- actions in 'IO'. In this case it is to allow running 'ST' actions within
-- another monad @m@.
--
-- The type of 'stToIO' is:
--
-- > stToIO : ST RealWorld a -> IO a
--
-- Abstracting over this is tricky because we need to not care about both
-- the @IO@, and also the @RealWorld@.
--
-- A solution is to write an action that is given the @liftST@ as an argument
-- and where that action itself is polymorphic in the @s@ parameter. This
-- allows us to instantiate it with @RealWorld@ in the @IO@ case, and the local
-- @s@ in a case where we are embedding into another @ST@ action.
