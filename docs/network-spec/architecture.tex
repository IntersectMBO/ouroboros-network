\section{Protocols and node design}
There are two protocols which support different sets of mini-protocols:
\begin{itemize}
  \item\hyperref[table:node-to-node-protocol-numbers]{node-to-node} protocol
    for communication between different nodes usually run by different
    entities across the globe.  It consists of
    \hyperref[chain-sync-protocol]{chain-sync},
    \hyperref[block-fetch-protocol]{block-fetch},
    \hyperref[tx-submission-protocol]{tx-submission} and
    \hyperref[keep-alive-protocol]{keep-alive} mini-protocols.
  \item\hyperref[table:node-to-client-protocol-numbers]{node-to-client}
    protocol for intra-process communication, which allows to build
    applications that need access to the blockchain, ledger, e.g. a wallet, an
    explorer, etc.  It consists of \hyperref[chain-sync-protocol]{chain-sync},
    \hyperref[local-tx-submission-protocol]{local-tx-submission} and
    \hyperref[local-state-query-protocol]{local-state-query} mini-protocols.
\end{itemize}

Chain-sync mini-protocol (the node-to-node version) is used to replicate
a remote chain of headers; block-fetch mini-protocol to download blocks and
tx-submission to desiminate transactions across the network.

Figure~\ref{node-diagram-concurrency} illustrates design of a node.  Circles
represents threads that run one of the mini-protocols.  
Each mini-protocols communicate with a remote node over the network.
Threads communicate communicate by means of a shared mutable variables, which
are represented by boxes in Figure~\ref{node-diagram-concurrency}.
We heavily use
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory}{Software
transactional memory} (STM), which is a mechanism for safe and lock-free
concurrent access to mutable state (see \cite{stm:harris2006}).

The ouroboros-network supports multiplexing mini-protocols, which allows to run
node-to-node or node-to-client protocol on a single bearer, e.g. a TCP
connection, other bearers are also supported.  This means that chain-sync,
block-fetch and tx-submission mini-protocols will share a single TCP
connection.  The multiplexer, its framing is described in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:multiplexer}.

\section{Congestion Control}
A central design goal of the system is robust operation at high workloads.  For
example, it is a normal working condition of the networking design that
transactions arrive at a higher rate than the number that can be included in
blockchain.  An increase of the rate at which transactions are submitted must
not cause a decrease of the block chain quality.

Point-to-point TCP bearers do not deal well with overloading.  A TCP connection
has a certain maximal bandwidth, i.e. a certain maximum load that it can handle
relatively reliably under normal conditions.  If the connection is ever
overloaded, the performance characteristics will degrade rapidly unless the
load presented to the TCP connection is appropriately managed.

At the same time, the node itself has a limit on the rate at which it can
process data.  In particular, a node may have to share its processing power
with other processes that run on the same machine/operation system instance,
which means that a node may get slowed down for some reason, and the system may
get in a situation where there is more data available from the network than the
node can process.  The design must operate appropriately in this situation and
recover form transient conditions.  In any condition, a node must not exceed
its memory limits, that is there must be defined limits, breaches of which
being treated like protocol violations.

Of cause it makes no sense if the system design is robust, but so defensive
that it fails to meet performance goals.  An example would be a protocol that
never transmits a message unless it has received an explicit ACK for the
previous message. This approach might avoid overloading the network, but would
waste most of the potential bandwidth.  To avoid such performance problems, our
implementation is heavily using protocol pipelining.


\section{Real-time Constraints and Coordinated Universal Time}
Ouroboros models the passage of physical time as an infinite sequence of time
slots, i.e. contiguous, equal-length intervals of time, and assigns slot
leaders (nodes that are eligible to create a new block) to those time slots.
At the beginning of a time slot, the slot leader selects the block chain and
transactions that are the basis for the new block, then it creates the new
block and sends the new block to its peers.  When the new block reaches the
next block leader before the beginning of next time slot, the next block leader
can extend the block chain upon this block (if the block did not arrive on time
the next leader will create a new block anyway).

There are some trade-offs when choosing the slot time that is used for the
protocol but basically the slot length should be long enough such that a new
block has a good chance to reach the next slot leader in time.  It is assumed
that the clock skews between the local clocks of the nodes is small with
respect to the slot length.

However, no matter how accurate the local clocks of the nodes are with respect
to the time slots the effects of a possible clock skew must still be carefully
considered.  For example, when a node time-stamps incoming blocks with its
local clock time, it may encounter blocks that are created in the future with
respect to the local clock of the node.  The node must then decide whether this
is because of a clock skew or whether the node considers this as adversarial
behavior of an other node.
