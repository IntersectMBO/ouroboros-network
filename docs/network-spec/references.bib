  abstract = {This paper introduces a mechanism for asserting invariants that are maintained by a program that uses atomic memory transactions. The idea is simple: a programmer writes check E where E is an expression that should be preserved by every atomic update for the remainder of the program's execution. We have extended STM Haskell to dynamically evaluate check statements atomically with the user's updates: the result is that we can identify precisely which update is the first one to break an invariant.},
