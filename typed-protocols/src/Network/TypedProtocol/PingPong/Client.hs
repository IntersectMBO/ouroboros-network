-- | A ping-pong client, on top of some effect 'm'.
--
-- At each step the client has a choice: ping or stop.
--
-- This type encodes the pattern of state transitions the client can go through.
-- For the ping\/pong case this is trivial. We start from one main state,
-- issue a ping and move into a state where we expect a single response,
-- bringing us back to the same main state.
--
-- If we had another state in which a different set of options were available
-- then we would need a second type like this. The two would be mutually
-- recursive if we can get in both directions, or perhaps just one way such
-- as a special initialising state or special terminating state.
--

  -- | Choose to go for sending a ping message. The ping has no body so
  -- all we have to provide here is a continuation for the single legal
  -- reply message.

  -- we terminate with the local result value. So this ends up being much like
  -- 'return' in this case, but in general the termination is a message that
  -- can communicate final information.
