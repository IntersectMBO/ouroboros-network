-- | Create a pair of channels that are connected via buffers with delays.
--
-- This is a crude approximation of asynchronous network connections where
-- there is delay across the connection, and a limit on in-flight data.
--
-- The buffer size is bounded. It /blocks/ when 'send' would exceed the maximum
-- buffer size. The size per channel element is provided by a function, so this
-- can be size in bytes or a fixed size (e.g. 1 per element), so the max size
-- should be interpreted accordingly.
--
-- The delays are modeled in a simplistic "GSV" style:
--
-- * The G is the minimum latency for a 0 sized message.
-- * The S is the time per message size unit.
-- * The V is the variance in latency, which is assumed to be uniform in the
--   range @0..v@.
--
-- The sender is delayed by S. The receiver is delayed until the arrival time
-- which is G + S + V.
--
-- Note that this implementation does not handle the delays correctly if there
-- are multiple writers or multiple readers.
--
-- This is primarily useful for testing protocols.
