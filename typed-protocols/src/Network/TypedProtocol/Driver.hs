-- = Driving a Peer by was of a Duplex and Channel
--
-- A 'Duplex' allows for sending and receiving pieces of some concrete type.
-- In applications, this will probably be some sort of socket. In order to
-- use it to drive a typed protocol application (represented by a 'Peer'),
-- there must be a way to encode typed transitions of that protocol to the
-- concrete type, and to parse pieces of that concrete type incrementally into
-- a typed transition. This is defined by a 'Codec'.
--
-- A 'Codec' and a 'Duplex' alone is not enough to do encoding and decoding,
-- because the 'Codec' does not make any /decisions/ about the way in which
-- the protocol application progresses. It defines encodings for /all/ possible
-- transitions from a state, and an inverse for that encoder. It's the 'Peer'
-- term which decides which transitions to encode, thereby leading the 'Codec'
-- through a path in the protocol type.
--
-- Driving a 'Peer' in this way may give rise to an exception, given by
-- @'Unexpected' :: 'Result' t@.
