-- $intro
--
-- A 'Peer' is a particular implementation of an agent that engages in a
-- typed protocol. To actualy run one we need a source and sink for the typed
-- protocol messages. These are provided by a 'Channel' and a 'Codec'. The
-- 'Channel' represents one end of an untyped duplex message transport, and
-- the 'Codec' handles conversion between the typed protocol messages and
-- the untyped channel.
--
-- So given the 'Peer' and a compatible 'Codec' and 'Channel' we can run the
-- peer in some appropriate monad. The peer and codec have to agree on
-- the same protocol and role in that protocol. The codec and channel have to
-- agree on the same untyped medium, e.g. text or bytes. All three have to
-- agree on the same monad in which they will run.
--
-- This module provides drivers for normal and pipelined peers. There is
-- very little policy involved here so typically it should be possible to
-- use these drivers, and customise things by adjusting the peer, or codec
-- or channel.
--
-- It is of course possible to write custom drivers and the code for these ones
-- may provide a useful starting point. The 'runDecoder' function may be a
-- helpful utility for use in custom drives.
