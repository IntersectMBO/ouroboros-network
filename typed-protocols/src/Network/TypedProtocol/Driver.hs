-- $intro
--
-- A 'Peer' is a particular implementation of an agent that engages in a
-- typed protocol. To actualy run one we need a source and sink for the typed
-- protocol messages. These are provided by a 'Channel' and a 'Codec'. The
-- 'Channel' represents one end of an untyped duplex message transport, and
-- the 'Codec' handles conversion between the typed protocol messages and
-- the untyped channel.
--
-- So given the 'Peer' and a compatible 'Codec' and 'Channel' we can run the
-- peer in some appropriate monad. The peer and codec have to agree on
-- the same protocol and role in that protocol. The codec and channel have to
-- agree on the same untyped medium, e.g. text or bytes. All three have to
-- agree on the same monad in which they will run.
--
-- This module provides drivers for normal and pipelined peers. There is
-- very little policy involved here so typically it should be possible to
-- use these drivers, and customise things by adjusting the peer, or codec
-- or channel.
--
-- It is of course possible to write custom drivers and the code for these ones
-- may provide a useful starting point. The 'runDecoder' function may be a
-- helpful utility for use in custom drives.

    -- Note that we do not complain about trailing data in any case, neither
    -- the 'Await' nor 'Done' cases.
    --
    -- We want to be able to use a non-pipelined peer in communication with
    -- a pipelined peer, and in that case the non-pipelined peer will in
    -- general see trailing data after an 'Await' which is the next incoming
    -- message.
    --
    -- Likewise for 'Done', we want to allow for one protocols to be run after
    -- another on the same channel. It would be legal for the opening message
    -- of the next protocol arrives in the same data chunk as the final
    -- message of the previous protocol.

-- | The handling of trailing data here is quite subtle. Trailing data is data
-- we have read from the channel but the decoder has told us that it comes
-- after the message we decoded. So it potentially belongs to the next message
-- to decode.
--
-- We read from the channel on both the 'runPipelinedPeerSender' and the
-- 'runPipelinedPeerReceiver', and we synchronise our use of trailing data
-- between the two. The scheme for the sender and receiver threads using the
-- channel ensures that only one can use it at once:
--
-- * When there are zero outstanding pipelined receiver handlers then the
--   sending side is allowed to access the channel directly (to do synchronous
--   yield\/awaits). Correspondingly the receiver side is idle and not
--   accessing the channel.
-- * When there are non-zero outstanding pipelined receiver handlers then
--   the receiver side can access the channel, but the sending side is not
--   permitted to do operations that access the channel.
--
-- So the only times we need to synchronise the trailing data are the times
-- when the right to access the channel passes from one side to the other.
--
-- The transitions are as follows:
--
-- * There having been Zero outstanding pipelined requests there is now a
--   new pipelined yield. In this case we must pass the trailing data from
--   the sender thread to the receiver thread. We pass it with the
--   'ReceiveHandler'.
--
-- * When the last pipelined request is collected. In this case we must pass
--   the trailing data from the receiver thread to the sender thread. We pass
--   it with the collected result.
--
-- Note that the receiver thread cannot know what the last pipelined request
-- is, that is tracked on the sender side. So the receiver thread always
-- returns the trailing data with every collected result. It is for the sender
-- thread to decide if it needs to use it. For the same reason, the receiver
-- thread ends up retaining the last trailing data (as well as passing it to
-- the sender). So correspondingly when new trailing data is passed to the
-- receiver thread, it simply overrides any trailing data it already had, since
-- we now know that copy to be stale.
