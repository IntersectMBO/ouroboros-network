-- Pipelined example
--

-- | An example request\/response client that sends the given list of requests
-- and collects the list of responses.
--
-- It is pipelined and tries to collect any replies if they are available.
-- This allows pipelining but keeps it to a minimum, and correspondingly it
-- gives maximum choice to the environment (drivers).
--
-- In theory, with enough and large enough requests and responses, this should
-- be able to saturate any channel of any bandwidth and latency, because it
-- should be able to have both peers send essentially continuously.
