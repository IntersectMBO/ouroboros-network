-- $about
--
-- Typed languages such as Haskell can embed proofs. In total languages this
-- is straightforward: a value inhabiting a type is a proof of the property
-- corresponding to the type.
--
-- In languages like Haskell that have ⊥ as a value of every type, things
-- are slightly more complicated. We have to demonstrate that the value that
-- inhabits the type of interest is not ⊥ which we can do by evaluation.
--
-- This idea crops up frequently in advanced type level programming in Haskell.
-- For example @Refl@ proofs that two types are equal have to have a runtime
-- representation that is evaluated to demonstrate it is not ⊥ before it
-- can be relied upon.
--
-- The proofs here are about the nature of typed protocols in this framework.
-- The 'connect' and 'connectPipelined' proofs rely on a few lemmas about
-- the individual protocol. See 'AgencyProofs'.


-- | The 'connect' and 'connectPipelined' proofs rely on lemmas about the
-- protocol. Specifically they rely on the property that each protocol state
-- is labelled with the agency of one peer or the other, or neither, but never
-- both. Or to put it another way, the protocol states should be partitioned
-- into those with agency for one peer, or the other or neither.
--
-- The way the labelling is encoded does not automatically enforce this
-- property. It is technically possible to set up the labelling for a protocol
-- so that one state is labelled as having both peers with agency, or declaring
-- simultaneously that one peer has agency and that neither peer has agency
-- in a particular state.
--
-- So the overall proofs rely on lemmas that say that the labelling has been
-- done correctly. This type bundles up those three lemmas.
--
-- Specifically proofs that it is impossible for a protocol state to have:
--
-- * client having agency and server having agency
-- * client having agency and nobody having agency
-- * server having agency and nobody having agency
--
-- These lemmas are structured as proofs by contradiction, e.g. stating
-- \"if the client and the server have agency for this state then it leads to
-- contradiction\". Contradiction is represented as the 'Void' type that has
-- no values except ⊥.
--
-- For example for the ping\/pong protocol, it has three states, and if we set
-- up the labelling correctly we have:
--
-- > data PingPong where
-- >   StIdle :: PingPong
-- >   StBusy :: PingPong
-- >   StDone :: PingPong
-- >
-- > data ClientHasAgency st where
-- >   TokIdle :: ClientHasAgency StIdle
-- >
-- > data ServerHasAgency st where
-- >   TokBusy :: ServerHasAgency StBusy
-- >
-- > data NobodyHasAgency st where
-- >   TokDone :: NobodyHasAgency StDone
--
-- So now we can prove that if the client has agency for a state then there
-- are no cases in which the server has agency.
--
-- > proofByContradiction_ClientAndServerHaveAgency TokIdle tok =
-- >   case tok of {}
--
-- For this protocol there is only one state in which the client has agency,
-- the idle state. By pattern matching on the state token for the server
-- agency we can list all the cases in which the server also has agency for
-- the idle state. There are of course none of these so we give the empty
-- set of patterns. GHC can check that we are indeed correct about this.
-- This also requires the @EmptyCase@ language extension.
--
-- To get this completeness checking it is important to compile modules
-- containing these lemmas with @-Wincomplete-patterns@, which is implied by
-- @-Wall@.
--
-- All three lemmas follow the same pattern.

-- | The 'connect' function takes two peers that agree on a protocol and runs
-- them in lock step, until (and if) they complete.
--
-- The 'connect' function serves a few purposes.
--
-- * The fact we can define this function at at all proves some minimal
-- sanity property of the typed protocol framework.
--
-- * It demonstrates that all protocols defined in the framework can be run
-- with synchronous communication rather than requiring buffered communication.
--
-- * It is useful for testing peer implementations against each other in a
-- minimalistic setting.
