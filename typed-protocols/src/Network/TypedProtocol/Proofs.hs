-- $about
--
-- Typed languages such as Haskell can embed proofs. In total languages this
-- is straightforward: a value inhabiting a type is a proof of the property
-- corresponding to the type.
--
-- In languages like Haskell that have ⊥ as a value of every type, things
-- are slightly more complicated. We have to demonstrate that the value that
-- inhabits the type of interest is not ⊥ which we can do by evaluation.
--
-- This idea crops up frequently in advanced type level programming in Haskell.
-- For example @Refl@ proofs that two types are equal have to have a runtime
-- representation that is evaluated to demonstrate it is not ⊥ before it
-- can be relied upon.
--
-- The proofs here are about the nature of typed protocols in this framework.
-- The 'connect' and 'connectPipelined' proofs rely on a few lemmas about
-- the individual protocol. See 'AgencyProofs'.




-- | The 'connect' function takes two peers that agree on a protocol and runs
-- them in lock step, until (and if) they complete.
--
-- The 'connect' function serves a few purposes.
--
-- * The fact we can define this function at at all proves some minimal
-- sanity property of the typed protocol framework.
--
-- * It demonstrates that all protocols defined in the framework can be run
-- with synchronous communication rather than requiring buffered communication.
--
-- * It is useful for testing peer implementations against each other in a
-- minimalistic setting.
