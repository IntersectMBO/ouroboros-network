-- | Rethrow policy for 'MuxConnectionHandler'.
--
-- Connection manager has a centralised way of handling exceptions.
-- 'RethrowPolicy' is a way to decided wheather it is enough to shutdown
-- connection or the node should shut down itself.  Theis mechanism is affected
-- by the design choices in the mutliplexer.
--
-- Whenever a mini-protocol throws an exception, the bearer is closed.  There is
-- no way to recover a bidirectional connection if one side failed, in such way
-- that the other end could still re-use it, e.g.  if the initiator throws, we
-- cannot just restart it on the same bearer, since there might be unconsumed
-- bytes on the other end.
--
-- 'RethrowPolicy' is supplied to 'makeMuxConnectionHandler' which creates both
-- the action that runs on each connection and error handler.  Error handler is
-- attached by the connection manager (see
-- 'Ouroboros.Network.ConnectionManager.Core').  This error handler is using
-- 'RethrowPolicy'.
--
-- This mechanism is enough for both:
--
--  * the server implemented in `Ouroboros.Network.ConnectionManager.Server',
--  * 'PeerStateActions' used by peer-to-peer governor.
--
-- Since both start mini-protocols with 'runMiniProtocol' they can also have
-- access to the result / exception thrown of a mini-protocol.
-- 'PeerStateActions' are only using this to inform the governor that the
-- peer transitioned to 'PeerCold' or to deactivate the peer.

-- | Weather an exception happend on outbound or inbound connection.
--
-- TODO: It would be more useful to have access weather the exception happend
-- on initiator or responder. The easiest way to fix this is make mux throw the
-- exception together with context.  This allows to keep error handling be done
-- only by the connection manager (rather than by server and
-- 'PeerStateActions').
