-- | An 'AnchoredFragment' is a fragment of a chain that is anchored somewhere
-- in that chain. The 'Anchor' corresponds to the block immediately before the
-- first, leftmost block in the fragment. The block corresponding to the anchor
-- is not present in the fragment. The anchor can be thought of as a left
-- exclusive bound.
--
-- For example, the following fragment is anchored at @a@ and contains @b1@,
-- @b2@, and @b3@, which is the head of the fragment.
--
-- > a ] b1 >: b2 >: b3
--
-- The fact that it is an /exclusive/ bound is particularly convenient when
-- dealing with Genesis. Genesis is the start of the chain, but not an actual
-- block, so we cannot use it an inclusive bound. However, there /is/ an
-- 'Anchor' that refers to Genesis ('AnchorGenesis'), which can be used as the
-- anchor, acting as an exclusive bound.
--
-- An 'AnchoredFragment' anchored at Genesis can thus be converted to a
-- 'Ouroboros.Network.Mock.Chain' ('fromAnchoredFragment'), containing all
-- blocks starting from Genesis.
--
-- Without an anchor point, an empty fragment wouldn't give us much more
-- information: is it empty because the whole chain is empty? Or, did we just
-- get an empty fragment that was split off from some later part of the chain?
