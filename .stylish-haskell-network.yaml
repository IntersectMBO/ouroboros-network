# Stylish-haskell configuration file used for the network layer
# It's based on default config provided by `stylish-haskell --defaults` but
# has some changes ==================================

# The stylish-haskell tool is mainly configured by specifying steps. These steps
# are a list, so they have an order, and one specific step may appear more than
# once (if needed). Each file is processed by these steps in the given order.
steps:
  # Convert some ASCII sequences to their Unicode equivalents. This is disabled
  # by default.
  # - unicode_syntax:
  #     # In order to make this work, we also need to insert the UnicodeSyntax
  #     # language pragma. If this flag is set to true, we insert it when it's
  #     # not already present. You may want to disable it if you configure
  #     # language extensions using some other method than pragmas. Default:
  #     # true.
  #     add_language_pragma: true
  - module_header:
  #     # How many spaces use for indentation in the module header.
      indent: 2
  #
  #     # Should export lists be sorted?  Sorting is only performed within the
  #     # export section, as delineated by Haddock comments.

  #     # See `separate_lists` for the `imports` step.
      separate_lists: true
  #
  #     # When to break the "where".
  #     # Possible values:
  #     # - exports: only break when there is an explicit export list.
  #     # - single: only break when the export list counts more than one export.
  #     # - inline: only break when the export list is too long. This is
  #     #   determined by the `columns` setting. Not applicable when the export
  #     #   list contains comments as newlines will be required.
  #     # - always: always break before the "where".
      break_where: single
  #     # Where to put open bracket
  #     # Possible values:
  #     # - same_line: put open bracket on the same line as the module name, before the
  #     #              comment of the module
  #     # - next_line: put open bracket on the next line, after module comment

  # Import cleanup
  - imports:

      #
      # - global: Align the import names and import list throughout the entire
      #   file.
      #
      # - file: Like global, but don't add padding when there are no qualified
      #   imports in the file.
      #
      # - group: Only align the imports per group (a group is formed by adjacent
      #   import lines).
      #
      # - none: Do not perform any alignment.
      #
      # Default: global.

      #   > import qualified Data.List      as List (concat, foldl, foldr, head,

  # Language pragmas
  - language_pragmas:
      # We can generate different styles of language pragma lists.
      #
      # - vertical: Vertical-spaced language pragmas, one per line.
      #
      # - compact: A more compact style.
      #
      # - compact_line: Similar to compact, but wrap each line with
      #   `{-#LANGUAGE #-}'.
      #
      # Default: vertical.

      # stylish-haskell can detect redundancy of some language pragmas. If this
      # is set to true, it will remove those redundant pragmas. Default: true.
      remove_redundant: true

  # Replace tabs by spaces. This is disabled by default.
  # - tabs:
  #     # Number of spaces to use for each tab. Default: 8, as specified by the
  #     # Haskell report.
  #     spaces: 8

  # Remove trailing whitespace
  - trailing_whitespace: {}

# A common setting is the number of columns (parts of) code will be wrapped
# to. Different steps take this into account. Default: 80.
columns: 80

# By default, line endings are converted according to the OS. You can override
# preferred format here.
#
# - native: Native newline format. CRLF on Windows, LF on other OSes.
#
# - lf: Convert to LF ("\n").
#
# - crlf: Convert to CRLF ("\r\n").
#
# Default: native.
newline: native

# These syntax-affecting language extensions are enabled so that
# stylish-haskell wouldn't fail with parsing errors when processing files
# in projects that have those extensions enabled in the .cabal file
# rather than locally.
#
# To my best knowledge, no harm should result from enabling an extension
# that isn't actually used in the file/project. —@neongreen
