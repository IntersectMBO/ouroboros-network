-- | Test if the mempool treats small and large transactions in the same way.
--
-- We run the following test:
--
-- - Given a mempool 'mp'.
-- - Concurrently:
--     - Run 'N' threads that add small transactions to 'mp'.
--     - Run 'N' threads that add large transactions to 'mp'.
--     - Remove transactions from 'mp' one by one, with a small delay between
--       removals. Collect the removed transactions.
--
-- We give the threads that add small transactions a head start to make sure
-- that the mempool fills up with small transactions. In this way the thread
-- that removes transactions one by one will remove small transactions first.
-- Then, if the mempool is fair, it will not always try to add a small
-- transaction as soon as it can, but it will eventually wait until enough
-- capacity has been freed (by the remover thread) so that a large transaction
-- can be added.
--
-- After collecting 'M' removed transactions, let 'diff' be the difference between
-- the number of small and large transactions that were added to 'mp', then we
-- check that:
--
-- > diff / M <= toleranceThreshold
--
-- See 'TestParams' for an explanation of the different parameters that
-- influence this test.
