--
-- Definition of the /Praos Race Assumption/. We assume every adversarial chain
-- contains at most @k@ blocks in the Praos Race Window anchored at the
-- intersection.
--
-- Definition of the /Extended Praos Race Assumption/. Beyond the Praos Race
-- Assumption, we assume that every adversarial chain also has at most @k@
-- blocks in every subsequent Praos Race Window that ends within 'Delta' of the
-- Stability Window anchored at the first adverarial block. (Crucially, these
-- are the Praos Race Windows in which the the adversary could not yet have
-- drastically accelerated its rate of election.)
--
-- Remark. The Praos Enriched Honest Chain Growth Assumption ensures the
-- adversary cannot accelerate until after it has lost the first race.
--
-- Definition of the /Genesis Implication Conjecture/. We conjecture that
-- assuming that the Genesis window length is no greater than the Stability
-- Window and that every possible adversarial chain satisfies the Extended Praos
-- Race Assumption implies the honest chain strictly wins every possible density
-- comparison from the Ouroboros Genesis paper. The key intuition is that a less
-- dense chain would have to lose at least one race within the Genesis window.
