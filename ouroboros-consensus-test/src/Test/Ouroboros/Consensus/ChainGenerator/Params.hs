-- | The Δ parameter of the Praos Race Assumption
--
-- ASSUMPTION: If an honest block @b@ is minted at the start of slot @x@, then
-- every (healthy) honest node will have selected a chain no worse than @b@ by
-- the onset of slot @x + Δ + 1@.
--
-- NOTE: If @Δ=0@, then the best block minted in each slot is selected by every
-- (healthy) honset before the onset of the next slot.
--
-- NOTE: If the honest block @k+1@ after the intersection was minted in slot
-- @x@, then the adversarial block @k+1@ after the intersection can be minted no
-- sooner than slot @x + Δ + 1@. Thus @x + Δ@ is the youngest slot in the Praos
-- Race Window.

-- | The @k@ parameter of the Praos Common Prefix property

-- Also known as the 'Ouroboros.Consensus.Config.SecurityParam.SecurityParam'.
newtype Kcp = Kcp Int
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)

-- | The @s@ parameter of the Praos Chain Growth property
--
-- Also known as the width of the /stability window/. In particular, we assume
-- that an adversarial stake holder cannot drastically increase their rate of
-- election until at least @s@ many slots after the first block on an
-- adversarial chain.
--
-- In other words: we're assuming that any serious attempt to corrupt the leader
-- schedule would be isolated to a private adversarial chain.
--
-- Note: this is also a parameter to the separate Enriched Praos Chain Growth
-- property; see 'Test.Ouroboros.Consensus.ChainGenerator.Honest.checkHonestChain'.
