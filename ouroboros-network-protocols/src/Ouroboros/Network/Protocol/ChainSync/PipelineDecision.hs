-- | Pipeline decision: we can do either one of these:
--
-- * non-pipelined request
-- * pipeline a request
-- * collect or pipeline, but only when there are pipelined requests
-- * collect, as above, only when there are pipelined requests
--
-- There might be other useful pipelining scenarios: collect a given number of
-- requests (which also can be used to collect all outstanding requests).

-- | The callback gets the following arguments:
--
-- * how many requests are not yet collected (in flight or
--   already queued)
-- * block number of client's tip
-- * block number of server's tip
--
-- Client's tip block number and server's tip block number can only be equal
-- (from the client's perspective) when both the client's and the server's tip
-- headers agree. If they would not agree (server forked), then the server
-- sends 'MsgRollBackward', which rolls back one block and causes the client's
-- tip and the server's tip to differ.
--
-- In this module we implement three pipelining strategies:
--
-- * 'pipelineDecisionMax'
-- * 'pipelineDecisionMin'
-- * 'pipelineDecisionLowHighMark'
