-- | The type of the keep alive protocol.
--
-- The keep alive protocol is used for
--
-- * sending keep alive messages
-- * making round trip measuremnets
--
-- Each side will run its own version of the keep alive protocol.  It should be
-- configured so that any intermediate state (such as in customer premise
-- equipment or in a carrier grade NAT) is kept alive. This has to be a per-node
-- configuration element as this is about the properties of that nodes network
-- connectivity.
--
-- For making round trip measurements its in the interest of the other side to
-- reply promptly.
