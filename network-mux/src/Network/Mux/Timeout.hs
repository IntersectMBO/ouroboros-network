--
-- This implementation has a serial constraint: the body action that calls
-- @timeout@ can /only do so from one thread at once/.
--
-- Further details for the curious:
--
-- the problem with @System.Timeout.timeout@ is that (as of base 4.12) it has
-- two implementations, one for Unix with the threaded RTS, and one for all
-- other configurations.
--
-- The Unix threaded RTS implementation is rather clever and very fast. In the
-- normal case of no timeout, it only has to allocate a timer entry. Only in
-- the case the timeout occurs does it allocate a 'forkIO' thread to do the
-- potentially-blocking operation of sending the asynchronous exception to
-- interrupt the action under timeout.
--
-- The implementation for all other configurations has to allocate a 'forkIO'
-- thread up front, whether or not the timeout fires. This is fine for many
-- applications but not for network timers which have to be created and
-- altered\/cancelled with very high frequency.
--
-- The implementation here only relies upon 'threadDelay' which has an
-- efficient implementation on all platforms. It uses a separate monitoring
-- thread which will throw an exception to terminate the action if the
-- timeout expires. This is why it uses the \"with\" style: because it keeps
-- a monitoring thread over a region of execution that may use many timeouts.
-- The cost of allocating this thread is amortised over all the timeouts used.
--
-- This implementation is simplified by the constraint that the timeouts only
-- be used serially. In addition, it has the limitation that timeouts may not
-- always be detected promptly: e.g. a 10s timeout on an action that finishes
-- immediately, followed by a 5s timeout on an action will only actually be
-- interrupted after 10s. So it's possible that action with the 5s timeout runs
-- for up to 10s. This is ok for many applications provided that the variance
-- in timeouts is not too large and the timeouts don't need to be too tight.
