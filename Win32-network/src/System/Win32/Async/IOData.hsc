-- | This closed type family which maps 'AysncType' to overlapping type.

-- | Data associated with each async call.  It is represented as the 'IODATA'
-- struct.
--
--  When an async call is initialised, e.g. 'ReadFile', the windows api takes
--  a pointer to 'OVERLAPPED' or 'WSAOVERLAPPED' in case of 'winsock2'.  When
--  it completes 'GetQueuedCompletionStatus' returns the 'OVERLAPPED' (or
--  'WSAOVERLAPPED') in the same memory location.  Since we keep 'OVERLAPPED'
--  ('WSAOVERLAPPED') as a first member of  '_IODATA' ('_WSAIODATA') struct, we
--  can cast a pointer to 'OVERLAPPED' ('WSAOVERLAPPED') to recover a pointer
--  to '_IODATA'  ('_WSAIODATA)' and thus recover 'IOData asyncType', including
--  the stable pointer.
--
--  The 'dequeueCompletionPackets' (which calls 'GetQueuedCompletionStatus'
--  fills the 'MVar' with the result returned by 'GetQueuedCompletionStatus'
--  (or 'GetLastError').
--
--  Outside of this module the type synonim 'IOCPData', 'AsyncIOCPData' or
--  'WsaIOCPData' should be used.

-- | We can safly cast a pointer to @'OverlappedType' asyncType@ to a pointer
