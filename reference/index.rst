Ouroboros Network Docs
======================

The network documentation is a work in progress, we have various
documents in various stages:

-  `Shelly Network Design`_ The scope of this document is to describe
   and justify design decisions. It is a work in progress.

   Snapshot sent for review:

   -  `V1.5 for internal review`_ with internal appendices
   -  `V1.5 for external review`_ without internal appendices

-  `Technical report`_ which contains technical documentation of the
   network stack: mux layer, protocol descriptions and their state
   machines. Other parts of the document will be merged / reused in the
   ``Shelley Network Design`` document. Our aim is to join the two
   docuents into one consistent form. The technical parts are largely
   finished, though they need to be synced with recent changes in
   ``ouroboros-network`` repository.

-  `Ouroboros-Network Component Overview`_ - an overview of all the
   components maintained by the networking team.

-  `Network Implementation Overview`_ This is a short document which
   just give an overview of the network stack.

-  `Data diffusion and peer discovery`_ a mind map of notions which was
   compiled to initially organise our knowledge (requires `xmind`_).
