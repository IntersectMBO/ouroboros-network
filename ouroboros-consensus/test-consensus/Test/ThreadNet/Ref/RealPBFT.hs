-- | This node join plan does not introduce any ambiguity
--
-- There is currently only one source of ambiguity. Suppose only one slot has
-- been lead, so the net has a single one-block chain. If the second lead slot
-- is lead by a node that also joins in that same slot, then that node will
-- forge its own one-block chain before it synchronizes with the net. This
-- process may continue for the third lead slot, and so on. It necessarily
-- stops in one of two ways:
--
--   * One of the competing nodes leads for a second time. Because of
--     round-robin, this will be the first leader again.
--
--   * A new node leads in a slot after its join slot. It will have
--     synchronized with the net and chosen one of the one-block chains. It
--     will forge a block atop that, and then the whole network will choose
--     this new longest chain. This reference simulator, in general, cannot
--     anticipate which of the competing one-block chains this node will have
--     selected, so this case is considered non-deterministic.
--
-- Once the net contains a chain with more than one-block, there will never be
-- anymore contention. Nodes might still join and immediately forge their own
-- one-block chain, but it will not be competitive with the net's necessarily
-- longer chain.
