-- The real implementation of course is stateful, running some code at various
-- intervals. We have a model of the implementation along with some @QuickCheck@
-- properties checking various invariants of the model such as
--
-- * The length of the queue is bounded
-- * The overlap between the volatile DB and immutable DB (due to blocks that
--   could have been moved but haven't yet) is bounded.
--
-- We then test that the real implementation behaves exactly as the model

-- | Property 1
--
-- 'queueLength' <= 'gcDelay' `div` 'gcInterval' + @slack@
--
-- Where:
-- * @slack = 1@ when 'gcInterval' divides 'gcDelay'. In this case, the delay
--   divides the interval nicely in different buckets. However, if we're not
--   at the start of a bucket and part of it is in the past, we'll need one
--   extra bucket to compensate, hence 1.
-- * @slack = 2@ in the other cases: in addition to the 1 of the previous
--   case, we must also account for one extra bucket because 'gcInterval'
--   doesn't nicely divide 'gcDelay' into buckets. In other words: we need to
--   round up.
