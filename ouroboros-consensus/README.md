  protocol tests simulating various node setups.

* `../ouroboros-consensus-byronspec`: integration with the Byron spec ledger.
  This is used to run the Byron protocol tests in lockstep with the spec to
  detect any discrepancies.

* `../ouroboros-consensus-shelley`: integration with the Shelley ledger,
  including protocol tests simulating various node setups.

* `../ouroboros-consensus-cardano`: the consensus instantiated to the ledgers
  the `cardano-node` currently supports.
