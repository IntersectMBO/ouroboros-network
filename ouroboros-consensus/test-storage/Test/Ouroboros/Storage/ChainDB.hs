-- | Chain DB tests.
--
-- The chain DB is the most complicated part of the storage layer, and this is
-- visible in the tests also. We have separate tests for:
--
-- * The GC schedule: the chain database occassionally garbage collects blocks
--   from the volatile DB that it is sure it won't need anymore (because adopting
--   them would result in switching to a fork that is too distant from our own
--   chain).
-- * Iterators. Iterators are cursors that allow to read a sequence of blocks
--   from the DB. The iterators provided by the chain DB can span both the
--   immutable DB and the volatile DB, some of those blocks might be /moved/
--   from the volatile DB /to/ the immutable DB during the iterator's life-time,
--   and some of those blocks might be garbage collected from the volatile DB.
--   This makes the iterator code quite complex, having to deal with a lot of
--   edge cases. Their main tests are part of the model based test, but we also
--   test some specific properties of the iterators themselves.
-- * The model of the chain DB /itself/ is reasonably complex also, and so we
--   have some properties that verify that that the model behaves the way we
--   think it should.
-- * The main DB itself.
