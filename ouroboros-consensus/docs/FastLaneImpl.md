# Implementation overview of Diffusion Pipelining via Delayed Validation

> TODO: Add links to the architectural document ([#3597](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3579)) and the FastLane sketch ([#3569](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3569)).

## Changes to ouroboros-network

The new FastLane mini protocol is modeled by this simple state machine, where `StIdle` is the initial state, and green and red indicate client and server agency, respectively:

> TODO: Add the CBOR codec as well as the low-level client and server implementation. The client should be pipelined at a low depth to hide latency and to allow a peer to quickly communicate its new best block header without having to wait for a new FastLane request (new FastLane headers are always preferable).
>
> This should be a straightforward adaption of code of other mini protocols.

## Next priority

The next focus lies on implementing the submission of the FastLane headers to the BlockFetch machinery and ensuring that the ChainDB can differentiate between normal and FastLane blocks.
