# How to contribute to the Consensus Layer

See the follow documents.

  * this repository's [README][repo-README]; it links to design documents
  * Consensus [style guide][consensus-style]
  * Consensus [git process][consensus-git]
  * Consensus [onboarding][consensus-onboarding]
  * TODO quick-start guide

Our primary neighbors are the upstream [cardano-ledger-specs] and the downstream
[cardano-node].

If you're not an IOHK employee, please fork the repository on GitHub and open
PRs that way. We're excited about your involvement; thank you!

If you're an IOHK employee, work with your manager and DevOps to acquire
permissions to push branches to and open PRs in this repository. If you're
working as part of the Consensus Team, also acquire permissions to Approve PRs
(in particular, our `bors` bot must accept your commands). You'll eventually
also need to be in the `CODEOWNERS` file. The general IOHK onboarding should
have discussed establishing hardware-based Two Factor Authentication on your
GitHub account; that's another prerequisite.
