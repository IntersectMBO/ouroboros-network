\section{Union of the Volatile DB and the Immutable DB}
\label{chaindb:union}

As discussed in \cref{storage:components}, the blocks in the Chain DB are
divided between the Volatile DB (\cref{volatile}) and the Immutable DB
(\cref{immutable}). Yet, it presents a unified view of the two databases.
Whereas the Immutable DB only contains the immutable chain and the Volatile DB
the volatile \emph{parts} of multiple forks, by combining the two, the Chain DB
contains multiple forks.

\subsection{Looking up blocks}
\label{chaindb:union:lookup}

Just like the two underlying databases the Chain DB allows looking up a
\lstinline!BlockComponent! of a block by its point. By comparing the slot number
of the point to the slot of the immutable tip, we could decide in which database
to look up the block. However, this would not be correct: the point might have a
slot older than the immutable tip, but refer to a block not in the Immutable DB,
i.e., a block on an older fork. More importantly, there is a potential race
condition: between the time at which the immutable tip was retrieved and the
time the block is retrieved from the Volatile DB, the block might have been
copied to the Immutable DB and garbage collected from the Volatile DB, resulting
in a false negative. Nevertheless, the overlap between the two makes this
scenario very unlikely.

For these reasons, we look up a block in the Chain DB as follows. We first look
up the given point in the Volatile DB. If the block is not in the Volatile DB,
we fall back to the Immutable DB. This means that if, at the same, a block is
copied from the Volatile DB to the Immutable DB and garbage collected from the
Volatile DB, we will still find it in the Immutable DB. Note that failed lookups
in the Volatile DB are cheap, as no disk access is required.

\subsection{Iterators}
\label{chaindb:union:iterators}

Similar to the Immutable DB (\cref{immutable:api:iterators}), the Chain DB
allows streaming blocks using iterators. We only support streaming blocks from
the current chain or from a recent fork. We \emph{do not} support streaming from
a fork that starts before the current immutable tip, as these blocks are likely
to be garbage collected soon. Moreover, it is of no use to us to serve another
node blocks from a fork we discarded.

We might have to stream blocks from the Immutable DB, the Volatile DB, or from
both. If the end bound is older or equal to the immutable tip, we simply try to
open an Immutable DB iterator with the given bounds. If the end bound is newer
than the immutable tip, we construct a path of points (see
\lstinline!filterByPredecessor! in \cref{volatile:api}) connecting the end bound
to the start bound. This path is either entirely in the Volatile DB or it is
partial because a block is missing from the Volatile DB. If the missing block is
the tip of the Immutable DB, we will have to stream from the Immutable DB in
addition to the Volatile DB. If the missing block is not the tip of the
Immutable DB, we consider the range to be invalid. In other words, we allow
streaming from both databases, but only if the immutable tip is the transition
point between the two, it cannot be a block before the tip, as that would mean
the fork is too old.

\todo{TODO} Image?

To stream blocks from the Volatile DB, we maintain the constructed path of
points as a list in memory and look up the corresponding block (component) in
the Volatile DB one by one.

Consider the following scenario: we open a Chain DB iterator to stream the
beginning of the current volatile chain, i.e., the blocks in the Volatile DB
right after the immutable tip. However, before streaming the iterator's first
block, we switch to a long fork that forks off all the way back at our immutable
tip. If that fork is longer than the previous chain, blocks from the start of
our chain will be copied from the Volatile DB to the Immutable DB,\todo{link}
advancing the immutable tip. This means the blocks the iterator will stream are
now part of a fork older than $k$. In this new situation, we would not allow
opening an iterator with the same range as the already-opened iterator. However,
we do allow streaming these blocks using the already opened iterator, as the
blocks to stream are unlikely to have already been garbage collected.
Nevertheless, it is still theoretically possible\footnote{This is unlikely, as
there is a delay between copying and garbage collection (see
\cref{chaindb:gc:delay}) and there are network time-outs on the block fetch
protocol, of which the server-side (see \cref{servers:blockfetch}) is the
primary user of Chain DB iterators.} that such a block has already been garbage
collected. For this reason, the Chain DB extends the Immutable DB's
\lstinline!IteratorResult! type (see \cref{immutable:api:iterators}) with the
\lstinline!IteratorBlockGCed! constructor:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
data IteratorResult blk b =
    IteratorExhausted
  | IteratorResult b
  | IteratorBlockGCed (RealPoint blk)
\end{lstlisting}

There is another scenario to consider: we stream the blocks from the start of
the current volatile chain, just like in the previous scenario. However, in this
case, we do not switch to a fork, but our chain is extended with new blocks,
which means blocks from the start of our volatile chain are copied from the
Volatile DB to the Immutable DB. If these blocks have been copied and garbage
collected before the iterator is used to stream them from the Volatile DB (which
is unlikely, as explained in the previous scenario), the iterator will
incorrectly yield \lstinline!IteratorBlockGCed!. Instead, when a block that was
planned to be streamed from the Volatile DB is missing, we first look in the
Immutable DB for the block in case it has been copied there. After the block
copied to the Immutable has been streamed, we continue with the remaining blocks
to stream from the Volatile DB. It might be the case that the next block has
also been copied and garbage collected, requiring another switch to the
Immutable DB. In the theoretical worst case, we have to switch between the two
databases for each block, but this is nearly impossible to happen in practice.

\subsection{Followers}
\label{chaindb:union:followers}

In addition to iterators, the Chain DB also supports \emph{followers}. Unlike an
iterator, which is used to request a static segment of the current chain or a
recent fork, a follower is used to follow the \emph{current chain}. Either from
the start of from a suggested more recent point. Unlike iterators, followers are
dynamic, they will follow the chain when it grows or forks. A follower is
pull-based, just like its primary user, the chain sync server (see
\cref{servers:chainsync}). This avoids the need to have a growing queue of
changes to the chain on the server side in case the client side is slower.

The API of a follower is as follows:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
data Follower m blk a = Follower {
      followerInstruction         :: m (Maybe (ChainUpdate blk a))
    , followerInstructionBlocking :: m (ChainUpdate blk a)
    , followerForward             :: [Point blk] -> m (Maybe (Point blk))
    , followerClose               :: m ()
    }
\end{lstlisting}
%
The \lstinline!a! parameter is the same \lstinline!a! as the one in
\lstinline!BlockComponent! (see \cref{immutable:api:block-component}), as a
follower for any block component \lstinline!a! can be opened.

A follower always has an implicit position associated with it. The
\lstinline!followerInstruction! operation and its blocking variant allow
requesting the next instruction w.r.t.\ the follower's implicit position, i.e.,
a \lstinline!ChainUpdate!:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
data ChainUpdate block a =
    AddBlock a
  | RollBack (Point block)
\end{lstlisting}
%
The \lstinline!AddBlock! constructor indicates that to follow the current chain,
the follower should extend its chain with the given block (component). Switching
to a fork is represented by first rolling back to a certain point
(\lstinline!RollBack!), followed by at least as many new blocks
(\lstinline!AddBlock!) as blocks that have been rolled back. If we were to
represent switching to a fork using a constructor like:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
  | SwitchToFork (Point block) [a]
\end{lstlisting}
%
we would need to have many blocks or block components in memory at the same
time.

These operations are implemented as follows. In case the follower is looking at
the immutable part of the chain, an Immutable DB iterator is used and no
rollbacks will be encountered. When the follower has advanced into the volatile
part of the chain, the in-memory fragment containing the last $k$ headers is
used (see \cref{storage:inmemory}). Depending on the block component, the
corresponding block might have to be read from the Volatile DB.

When a new chain has been adopted during chain selection (see
\cref{chainsel:addblock}), all open followers that are looking at the part of
the current chain that was rolled back are updated so that their next
instruction will be the correct \lstinline!RollBack!. By definition, followers
looking at the immutable part of the chain will be unaffected.

By default, a follower will start from the very start of the chain, i.e., at
genesis. Accordingly, the first instruction will be an \lstinline!AddBlock! with
the very first block of the chain. As mentioned, the primary user of a follower
is the chain sync server, of which the clients in most cases already have large
parts of the chain. The \lstinline!followerForward! operation can be used in
these cases to find a more recent intersection from which the follower can
start. The client will sent a few recent points from its chain and the follower
will try to find the most recent of them that is on our current chain. This is
implemented by looking up blocks by their point in the current chain fragment
and the Immutable DB.

Followers are affected by garbage collection similarly to how iterators are
(\cref{chaindb:union:iterators}): when the implicit position of the follower is
in the immutable part of the chain, an Immutable DB iterator with a static range
is used. Such an iterator is not aware of blocks appended to the Immutable DB
since the iterator was opened. This means that when the iterator reaches its
end, we first have to check whether more blocks have been appended to the
Immutable DB. If so, a new iterator is opened to stream these blocks. If not, we
switch over to the in-memory fragment.

concurrency concerns, etc.

Discuss the problem of the effective queue size (\#2721).

\section{Marking invalid blocks}
\label{chaindb:invalidblocks}

The chain database keeps a set of hashes of known-to-be-invalid blocks.
This information is used by the chain sync client (\cref{chainsyncclient}) to
terminate connections to nodes with a chain that contains an invalid block.

\begin{lemma}
\label{chaindb:dont-mark-invalid-successors}
When the chain database discovers an invalid block $X$, it is sufficient
to mark only $X$; there is no need to additionally mark any successors of $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof (sketch).]
The chain sync client maintains a chain fragment corresponding to some suffix
of the upstream node's chain, and it preserves an invariant that that suffix
must intersect with the node's own current chain. It can therefore never be
the case that the fragment contains a successor of $X$ but not $X$ itself:
since $X$ is invalid, the node will never adopt it, and so a fragment that
intersects the node's current chain and includes a successor of $X$ \emph{must}
also contain $X$.
\end{proof}

TODO\todo{TODO}: We should discuss how this relates to GC (\cref{chaindb:gc}).

\section{Effective maximum rollback}

The maximum rollback we can support is bound by the length of the current  fragment. This will be less than $k$ only if

\begin{itemize}
\item We are near genesis and the immutable database is empty, or
\item Due to data corruption the volatile database lost some blocks
\end{itemize}

Only the latter case is some cause for concern: we are in a state where
conceptually we \emph{could} roll back up to $k$ blocks, but due to how we chose
to organise the data on disk (the immutable/volatile split) we cannot. One
option here would be to move blocks \emph{back} from the immutable DB to the
volatile DB under these circumstances, and indeed, if there were other parts of
the system where rollback might be instigated that would be the right thing to
do: those other parts of the system should not be aware of particulars of the
disk layout.

However, since the chain database is \emph{exclusively} in charge of switching
to forks, all the logic can be isolated to the chain database. So, when we have
a short volatile fragment, we will just not roll back more than the length of
that fragment. Conceptually this can be justified also: the fact that $I$ is the
tip of the immutable DB means that \emph{at some point} it was in our chain at
least $k$ blocks back, and so we considered it to be immutable: the fact that
some data loss occurred does not really change that. We may still roll back more
than $k$ blocks when disk corruption occurs in the immutable database, of
course.

One use case of the current fragment merits a closer examination. When the chain
sync client (\cref{chainsyncclient}) looks for an intersection between our chain
and the chain of the upstream peer, it sends points from our chain fragment. If
the volatile fragment is shorter than $k$ due to data corruption, the client
would have fewer points to send to the upstream node. However, this is the
correct behaviour: it would mean we cannot connect to upstream nodes who fork
more than $k$ of what \emph{used to be} our tip before the data corruption, even
if that's not where our tip is anymore. In the extreme case, if the volatile
database gets entirely erased, only a single point is available (the tip of the
immutable database $I$), and hence we can only connect to upstream nodes that
have $I$ on their chain.  This is precisely stating that we can only sync with
upstream nodes that have a chain that extends our immutable chain.

\section{Garbage collection}
\label{chaindb:gc}

Blocks on chains that are never selected, or indeed blocks whose
predecessor we never learn, will eventually be garbage collected when their
slot number number is more than $k$ away from the tip of the selected chain.\footnote{This is slot based rather than block based for historical
reasons only; we should probably change this.}

\begin{bug}
The chain DB (more specifically, the volatile DB) can still grow without bound
if we allow upstream nodes to rapidly switch between forks; this should be
addressed at the network layer (for instance, by introducing rate limiting for
rollback in the chain sync client, \cref{chainsyncclient}).
\end{bug}

Although this is GC of the volatile DB, I feel it belongs here more than in
the volatile DB chapter because here we know \emph{when} we could GC.
But perhaps it should be split into two: a section on how GC is implemented
in the volatile DB chapter, and then a section here how it's used in the
chain DB. References from elsewhere in the report to GC should probably
refer here, though, not to the vol DB chapter.

\subsection{GC delay}
\label{chaindb:gc:delay}

For performance reasons neither the immutable DB nor the volatile DB ever makes
explicit \lstinline!fsync! calls to flush data to disk. This means that when the
node crashes, recently added blocks may be lost. When this happens in the
volatile DB it's not a huge deal: when the node starts back up and the chain
database is initialised we just run chain selection on whatever blocks still
remain; in typical cases we just end up with a slightly shorter chain.

However, when this happens in the immutable database the impact may be larger.
In particular, if we delete blocks from the volatile database as soon as we add
them to the immutable database, then data loss in the immutable database would
result in a gap between the volatile database and the immutable database, making
\emph{all} blocks in the volatile database unusable. We can recover from this, but it
would result in a large rollback (in particular, one larger than $k$).

To avoid this, we currently have a delay between adding blocks to the immutable
DB and removing them from the volatile DB (garbage collection). The delay is
configurable, but should be set in such a way that the possibility that the
block has not yet been written to disk at the time of garbage collection is
minimised;a a relatively short delay should suffice (currently we use a delay of
1 minute), though there are other reasons for preferring a longer delay:

\begin{itemize}
\item Clock changes can more easily be accommodated with more overlap (\cref{{future:clockchanges}})
\item The time delay also determines the worst-case validity of iterators
(todo\todo{TODO}: reference to relevant section).
\end{itemize}

Larger delays will of course result in more overlap between the two databases.
During normal node operation this might not be much, but the overlap might be
more significant during bulk syncing.

Notwithstanding the above discussion, an argument could be made that the
additional complexity due to the delay is not worth it; even a ``rollback'' of
more than $k$ is easily recovered from\footnote{Note that the node will never
actually notice such a rollback; the node would crash when discovering data
loss, and then restart with a smaller chain}, and clock changes as well, as
iterators asking for blocks that now live on distant chains, are not important
use cases. We could therefore decide to remove it altogether.
