\chapter{Chain sync client}
\label{chainsyncclient}

\section{Header validation}
\label{chainsyncclient:validation}

Discuss the fact that we validate headers (maybe a forward reference to the genesis chapter, where this becomes critical).

Discuss that this means we need efficient access to the $k$ most recent ledger states (we refer to this section for that).

\section{Forecasting requirements}
\label{chainsyncclient:forecasting}

Discuss that forecasting must have sufficient range to validate a chain longer than our own chain, so that we can meaningfully apply chain selection.

NOTE: Currently \cref{low-density} contains such a discussion.

\section{Trimming}
\label{chainsyncclient:trimming}

\section{Interface to the block fetch logic}
\label{chainsyncclient:plausiblecandidates}

We should discuss here the (very subtle!) reasoning about how we establish
the precondition that allows us to compare candidates
(\cref{chainsel:fragments:precondition}). See
\lstinline!plausibleCandidateChain! in \lstinline!NodeKernel!
(PR \#2735).
