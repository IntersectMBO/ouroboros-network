\section{Introduction}
\label{hfc:intro}

\todo{} We should discuss terminology here: what we mean by a hard fork,
and how that is different from how the word is usually used.

We should mention that era transitions happen at epoch boundaries only.

Mention that we had to adjust the consensus layer in some ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Simplified chain selection (tip only; \cref{consensus:overview:chainsel})
\item Remove the assumption slot/time conversion is always possible (\cref{time})
\end{itemize}
