  OVERVIEW

  The overall chain consists of various /era/s. Each era has its own set of era
  parameters such as the slot length and epoch size, as well as its own block
  format, ledger format, ledger rules, etc. It is assumed that the overall
  /shape/ of the chain is known. In other words, we statically know which eras
  we expect and what their parameters are; adding an additional era would
  require a code update. What we /don't/ know precisely is /when/ we transition
  from one era to the next, i.e., the hard fork transition points.

  When we are at genesis, the chain therefore looks something like this:

  > *-------------------?--------------------?--------------------
  > ^
  > \-- tip

  where we have (in this example) three eras (say, Byron, Shelley and Goguen)
  and therefore two hard fork transitions. Hard forks happen at epoch
  boundaries; the exact 'EpochNo' of each hard fork is determined by the era
  preceding it. Naturally, the exact 'EpochNo' of /past/ hard forks is known:

  > ---------------A--------------*----------?--------------------
  >                               ^
  >                               \-- tip

  where A is a known hard fork transition, and the next hard fork transition
  is still unknown.

  SAFE ZONES

  Future hard fork points may be known or unknown, where "known" means
  "certain"; i.e., for Byron, it would mean an update proposal has been voted
  on, confirmed, endorsed, and that endorsement is at least @k@ blocks deep into
  the chain; for Shelley it means an update proposal is voted on and accepted,
  and that acceptance is at least @k@ blocks deep into the chain.

  When a hard fork point is still unknown, we assume that each era determines a
  "safe zone": a number of slots from the tip of the ledger in which it is
  guaranteed that the hard fork will not happen.

  > CASE (i)
  >
  > ---------------A--------------*----------?--------------------
  >                               \..../
  >                                safe
  >                                zone

  Since the hard fork will not happen in the safe zone, we can extend the use of
  the current set of era parameters past the tip into the safe zone, giving us a
  limited ability to make predictions for the future (such as converting between
  slot numbers and wallclock time).

  We assume that once a transition point is known (and no longer subject to
  roll-back), this is guaranteed not to change anymore and we can use the era's
  parameters up to the transition point:

  > CASE (ii)
  >
  > ---------------A--------------*----------------B--------------
  >                               \.............../
  >                                implicitly safe

  Moreover, we assume that we can extend B's safe zone from the point of the
  hard fork transition:

  > CASE (iii)
  >
  > ---------------A--------------*----------------B--------------
  >                               \.............../\..../
  >                                implicitly safe  safe
  >                                                 zone

  This is justified because the safe zones arise from stability requirements
  for the transactions that establish the transition point. The earliest point
  such a transaction could be included in the chain is after the hard fork
  transition, since it must be a transaction from the /new/ era.

  NOTE ON STABILITY

  If we used as yet /unconfirmed/ update proposals to determine hard fork
  transition points, then any of the resulting time conversions would be
  subject to rollback; if we switched to a different fork, time conversions
  might suddenly look different. Whilst this /may/ be doable, in practice this
  is a headache we would very much like to avoid. For example, it might mean
  that when a block comes in and we determine that it's from the future,
  we might have prematurely marked it as invalid. So, we insist that time
  conversions must be based on update propsals that are /certain/ (no longer
  subject to rollback). This means that the "safe zone" we have been discussing
  above must extend from the point of stability forward. Moreover, the safe zone
  must be long enough to include a sufficient number of blocks such that we can
  evaluate enough headers of an alternative fork (without having its blocks)
  to decide that we want to switch to that fork; since in the worst case that
  means we have to evaluate @k@ headers (or @k+1@), the safe zone must be long
  enough to cover @k@ blocks (and therefore a safe zone of @2k@ slots for Byron,
  and (probably) a safe zone of @3k/f@ slots for Shelley). Effectively, this
  means that consensus wants "stability itself to be stable"; we need a double
  safe zone after an update proposal has been confirmed.
