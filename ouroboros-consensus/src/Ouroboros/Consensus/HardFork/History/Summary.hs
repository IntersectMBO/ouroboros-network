  Summary

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

-- | Information about a specific era
--
-- The 'eraEnd' of the final era in the summary will be determined by the
-- safe zone considerations discussed above.
--
-- Let the start of the summary be @(t, s, e)@ (time, slot epoch), and the
-- end of the summary be @(t', s', e')@. We have one invariant relating
-- epochs and slots:
--
-- > INV-1a  e' == e + ((s' - s) / epochSize)
-- > INV-1b: s' == s + ((e' - e) * epochSize)
--
-- And another invariant relating time and slots:
--
-- > INV-2a: s' == s + ((t' - t) / slotLen)
-- > INV-2b: t' == t + ((s' - s) * slotLen)
--
-- Note that these aren't really two sets of independent invariants. @INV-1a@
-- follows from @INV-1b@:
--
-- >       s'                   == s + ((e' - e) * epochSize)
-- >       s' - s               ==     ((e' - e) * epochSize)
-- >      (s' - s) / epochSize  ==       e' - e
-- > e + ((s' - s) / epochSize) ==       e'
--
-- Similarly, @INV-2a@ follows from @INV-2b@:
--
-- >       t'                 == t + ((s' - s) * slotLen)
-- >       t' - t             ==     ((s' - s) * slotLen)
-- >      (t' - t) / slotLen  ==       s' - s

-- per era, emphasizing that this information is statically known.
--
-- The entry indices themselves are not used here, but the idea is that they
-- look something like @'[ByronBlock, ShelleyBlock, GoguenBlock]@ and do affect
-- the hard fork combinator. So far this is a list of block types, since most
-- of consensus is indexed by block types.

-- Unlike the 'Shape' of the chain, which is statically known, the 'Transitions'
-- are derived from the state of the ledger (hard fork transition points only
-- become known after a voting procedure).
--
-- Any transition listed here must be "certain". How certainty is established is
-- ledger dependent, but it should imply that this is no longer subject to
-- rollback.

  Constructing the summary

  NOTE: In practice, when using the hard fork combinator, we never ever call
  'summarize', and instead read off a summary from the 'HardForkState'. In
  that case, this serves primarily as a reference implementation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

-- | Construct hard fork 'Summary'
--
-- NOTE (on epoch to slot translation). In order to translate 'SlotNo' to
-- 'EpochNo', we simply "line up" all slots. For example, suppose we have
-- an initial 'EpochSize' of 10, and then an 'EpochSize' of 20 from 'EpochNo'
-- 3 onwards. We end up with something like
--
-- > Epoch | 0      | 1        | 2        | 3        | 4        | ..
-- > Slot  | 0 .. 9 | 10 .. 19 | 20 .. 29 | 30 .. 49 | 50 .. 69 | ..
--
-- We do this translation /independent/ from the 'minimumPossibleSlotNo'
-- for a particular ledger. This means that for ledgers where the
-- 'minimumPossibleSlotNo' is not zero (e.g., some ledgers might set it to 1),
-- the maximum number of blocks (aka filled slots) in an epoch is just 1 (or
-- more) less than the other epochs.

  -- what @ys@ is here, but we can nonetheless reason about how @|xs|@ and
  -- @|ys|@ might relate:
  --
  -- - @|xs| == |ys|@: this is the normal case; we and the server know about the
  --   same (number of) eras. No special care needs to be taken.
  --
  -- - @|xs| > |ys|@: we know about more eras than the server does. The server
  --   will send us era summaries for @1 <= n <= |ys|@ eras. For sure @n <
  --   |xs|@, so decoding will be unproblematic. The only slightly strange case
  --   is when @n == |ys|@: in this case, the server thinks we are in the final
  --   era, whereas in fact that era isn't actually final; consequently, the
  --   server will give us an unbounded summary for that "final" era. However,
  --   if we are following that particular server, treating that era as
  --   unbounded is okay, since we anyway won't be transitioning to the next
  --   era.
  --
  --   [TODO: Won't we be making any decisions that we might regret if we do
  --   eventually switch server..?]
  --
  -- - @|xs| < |ys|@: we know about fewer eras than the server does. This will
  --   happen when the server has been upgraded for the next hard fork, but the
  --   client hasn't yet. Pattern match on the number @n@ of eras that the
  --   server sends us summaries for:
  --
  --   o @n < |xs|@: Although the server knows about more eras than us, they
  --     actually only send us era summaries for fewer eras than we know about.
  --     This means that the transition to what _we_ believe is the final era is
  --     not yet known; the summary sent to us by the server is fine as is.
  --
  --   o @n == |xs|@: The server does not yet know about the transition out of
  --     what (we believe to be) the final era. In principle we could decide to
  --     leave the era summaries as-is; however, since _we_ consider that era to
  --     be the final one, we should regard it as unbounded (it does not make
  --     sense to have a bounded final era). We must therefore modify the final
  --     era summary. Of course this will mean that we will make some incorrect
  --     decisions; but as long as we aren't updated, we will anyway be unable
  --     to deal with the next era.
  --
  --   o @n > |xs|@: the server already knows about the transition to the next
  --     era after our final era. In this case we must drop all eras that we
  --     don't know about, and then modify again the final era to be unbounded,
  --     just like in the case above.
  --
  -- Since we do not know @|ys|@, we cannot actually implement the outermost
  -- case statement. However:
  --
  -- - If @|xs| > |ys|@, by definition @n < |xs|@, and hence we will not modify
  --   the era summary: this is what we wanted.
  --
  -- - If @|xs| == |ys|@, then at most @n == |xs|@, in which case we might
  --   "modify" the final era to be unbounded. But in this case, the server will
  --   consider that era to be final as well, and so it will _already_ be
  --   unbounded: effectively this means that this means we will leave the
  --   summary unchanged.
