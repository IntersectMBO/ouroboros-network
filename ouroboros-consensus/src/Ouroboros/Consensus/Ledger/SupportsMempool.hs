-- | Generalized transaction
--
-- The mempool (and, accordingly, blocks) consist of "generalized
-- transactions"; this could be "proper" transactions (transferring funds) but
-- also other kinds of things such as update proposals, delegations, etc.
data family GenTx blk :: Type

-- | Updating the ledger with a single transaction may result in a different
-- error type as when updating it with a block
type family ApplyTxErr blk :: Type

-- | A flag indicating whether the mempool should reject a valid-but-problematic
-- transaction, in order to to protect its author from penalties etc
--
-- The primary example is that, as of the Alonzo ledger, a valid transaction can
-- carry an invalid script. If a remote peer sends us such a transaction (over a
-- Node-to-Node protocol), we include it in a block so that the ledger will
-- penalize them them for the invalid script: they wasted our resources by
-- forcing us to run the script to determine it's invalid. But if our local
-- wallet -- which we trust by assumption -- sends us such a transaction (over a
-- Node-to-Client protocol), we would be a good neighbor by rejecting that
-- transaction: they must have made some sort of mistake, and we don't want the
-- ledger to penalize them.
data WhetherToIntervene
  = DoNotIntervene
    -- ^ We do not trust remote peers, so if a problematic-yet-valid transaction
    -- arrives over NTN, we accept it; it will end up in a block and the ledger
    -- will penalize them for it.
  | Intervene
    -- ^ We trust local clients, so if a problematic-yet-valid transaction
    -- arrives over NTC, we reject it in order to avoid the ledger penalizing
    -- them for it.

  -- | The maximum number of bytes worth of transactions that can be put into

  -- | Return the post-serialisation size in bytes of a 'GenTx' /when it is
  -- embedded in a block/. This size might differ from the size of the
  -- serialisation used to send and receive the transaction across the
  -- network.
  --
  -- This size is used to compute how many transaction we can put in a block
  -- when forging one.
  --
  -- For example, CBOR-in-CBOR could be used when sending the transaction
  -- across the network, requiring a few extra bytes compared to the actual
  -- in-block serialisation. Another example is the transaction of the
  -- hard-fork combinator which will include an envelope indicating its era
  -- when sent across the network. However, when embedded in the respective
  -- era's block, there is no need for such envelope.

  -- implement more efficiently. E.g., by returning the length of the
