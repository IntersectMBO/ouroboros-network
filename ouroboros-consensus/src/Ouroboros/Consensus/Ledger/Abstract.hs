  -- Since a block can only be applied to a single, specific, ledger state,

  -- very same ledger state, and therefore can't possibly fail.
  --
  -- It is worth noting that since we already know that the block is valid in
  -- the provided ledger state, the ledger layer should not perform /any/
  -- validation checks.

  --
  -- In other words, this means that we can roll back from point B to point A,
  -- and then roll forward to any block on any fork from A. Note that we can
  -- /not/ roll back to any siblings of A (such as A'), as that would require
  -- us to roll back at least @k + 1@ blocks, which we can't (by definition).
  --
  -- Given a ledger state at point B, we should be able to verify any of the
  -- headers (corresponding to the blocks) at point A or any of its successors
  -- on any fork, up to some maximum distance from A. This distance can be
  -- determined by the ledger, though must be at least @k@: we must be able to
  -- validate any of these past headers, since otherwise we would not be able to
  -- switch to a fork. It is not essential that the maximum distance extends
  -- into the future (@> k@), though it is helpful: it means that in the chain
  -- sync client we can download and validate headers even if they don't fit
  -- directly onto the tip of our chain.
  --
  -- The anachronistic ledger state at point B is precisely the ledger state
  -- that can be used to validate this set of headers. The bounds (in terms of
  -- slots) are a hint about its valid range: how far into the past can we look
  -- (at least @k@) and how far into the future (depending on the maximum
  -- distance supported by the ledger). It is however important to realize that
  -- this is not a full specification: after all, blocks @A@ and @A'@ have the
  -- same slot number, but @A@ can be validated using the anachronistic ledger
  -- view at @B@ whereas @A'@ can not.
  --
  -- Invariant: when calling this function with slot @s@ yields a
  -- 'SlotBounded' @sb@, then @'atSlot' sb@ yields a 'Just'.
