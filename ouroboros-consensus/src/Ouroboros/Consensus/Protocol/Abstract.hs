  -- | Projection of the ledger state the Ouroboros protocol needs access to
  --
  -- The 'LedgerView' is a summary of the state of the ledger that the consensus
  -- algorithm requires to do its job. Under certain circumstances the consensus
  -- algorithm may require the 'LedgerView' for slots in the past (before the
  -- current tip of the chain) or in the (near) future (beyond the tip of the
  -- current chain, without having seen those future blocks yet).
  --
  -- This puts limitations on what the 'LedgerView' can be. For example, it
  -- cannot be the "current stake distribution", since it is of course
  -- impossible to compute the current stake distibution for a slot in the
  -- future. This means that for a consensus algorithm that requires the
  -- stake distribution such as Praos, the 'LedgerView' for a particular slot
  -- must be the "stake distribution for the purpose of leader selection".
  -- This "relevant" stake distribution /can/ be computed for slots in the
  -- (near) future because it is based on historical stake, not current.
  --
  -- A somewhat unfortunate consequence of this is that some decisions that
  -- ought to live in the consensus layer (such as the decision precisely which
  -- historical stake to sample to determine the relevant stake distribution)
  -- instead live in the ledger layer. It is difficult to disentangle this,
  -- because the ledger may indeed /depend/ on those sampling decisions (for
  -- example, reward calculations /must/ be based on that same stake
  -- distribution).
  --
  -- There are also some /advantages/ to moving these sorts of decisions to the
  -- ledger layer. It means that the consensus algorithm can continue to
  -- function without modifications if we decide that the stake distribution for
  -- leader selection should be based on something else instead (for example,
  -- for some bespoke version of the blockchain we may wish to use a committee
  -- instead of a decentralized blockchain). Having sampling decisions in the
  -- ledger layer rather than the consensus layer means that these decisions can
  -- be made without modifying the consensus algorithm.
  --
  -- Note that for the specific case of Praos, whilst the ledger layer provides
  -- the relevant stake distribution, the precise leader election must still live
  -- in the consensus layer since that depends on the computation (and sampling)
  -- of entropy, which is done consensus side, not ledger side (the reward
  -- calculation does not depend on this).
