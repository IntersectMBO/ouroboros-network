-- | Compare the 'headBlockNo', which is a measure of the length of the chain,
-- of two anchored fragments.
--
-- A fragment with a head is always \"greater\" than one without. When both
-- fragments have no head (i.e. are empty), they are 'EQ'.
--
-- Note that an EBB can share its @BlockNo@ with another regular block. If
-- such an EBB is the head of one fragment and the regular block with the same
-- @BlockNo@ is the head of the other fragment, then this function will say
-- they are 'EQ', while in fact one fragment should be preferred over the
-- other.
--
-- This is not a big deal as we won't be seeing new EBBs, so they will not be
-- the head of a fragment very often anyway, only when catching up. As soon as
-- a new block/header is added to the fragment, the right decision will be
-- made again ('GT' or 'LT').

-- | Compare two (potentially empty!) 'AnchoredFragment's.
--
-- PRECONDITION: Either both fragments are non-empty or they intersect.
--
-- For a detailed discussion of this precondition, and a justification for the
-- definition of this function, please refer to the Consensus Report.
--
-- Usage note: the primary user of this function is the chain database. It
-- establishes the precondition in two different ways:
--
-- * When comparing a candidate fragment to our current chain, the fragment is
--   guaranteed (by the chain sync client) to intersect with our chain (indeed,
--   within at most @k@ blocks from our tip, although the exact distance does
--   not matter for 'compareAnchoredFragments').
-- * It will only compare candidate fragments that it has previously verified
--   are preferable to our current chain. Since these fragments intersect with
--   our current chain, they must by transitivity also intersect each other.
