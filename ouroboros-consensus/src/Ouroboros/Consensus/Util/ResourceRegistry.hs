-- | Resource registry
--
-- Note on terminology: when thread A forks thread B, we will say that thread A
-- is the " parent " and thread B is the " child ". No further relationship
-- between the two threads is implied by this terminology. In particular, note
-- that the child may outlive the parent. We will use "fork" and "spawn"
-- interchangeably.
--
-- = Motivation
--
-- Whenever we allocate resources, we must keep track of them so that we can
-- deallocate them when they are no longer required. The most important tool we
-- have to achieve this is 'bracket':
--
-- > bracket allocateResource releaseResource $ \r ->
-- >   .. use r ..
--
-- Often 'bracket' comes in the guise of a with-style combinator
--
-- > withResource $ \r ->
-- >   .. use r ..
--
-- Where this pattern is applicable, it should be used and there is no need to
-- use the 'ResourceRegistry'. However, 'bracket' introduces strict lexical
-- scoping: the resource is available inside the scope of the bracket, and
-- will be deallocated once we leave that scope. That pattern is sometimes
-- hard to use.
--
-- For example, suppose we have this interface to an SQL server
--
-- > query :: Query -> IO QueryHandle
-- > close :: QueryHandle -> IO ()
-- > next  :: QueryHandle -> IO Row
--
-- and suppose furthermore that we are writing a simple webserver that allows a
-- client to send multiple SQL queries, get rows from any open query, and close
-- queries when no longer required:
--
-- > server :: IO ()
-- > server = go Map.empty
-- >   where
-- >     go :: Map QueryId QueryHandle -> IO ()
-- >     go handles = getRequest >>= \case
-- >         New q -> do
-- >           h   <- query q                        -- allocate
-- >           qId <- generateQueryId
-- >           sendResponse qId
-- >           go $ Map.insert qId h handles
-- >         Close qId -> do
-- >           close (handles ! qId)                 -- release
-- >           go $ Map.delete qId handles
-- >         Next qId -> do
-- >           sendResponse =<< next (handles ! qId)
-- >           go handles
--
-- The server opens and closes query handles in response to client requests.
-- Restructuring this code to use 'bracket' would be awkward, but as it stands
-- this code does not ensure that resources get deallocated; for example, if
-- the server thread is killed ('killThread'), resources will be leaked.
--
-- Another, perhaps simpler, example is spawning threads. Threads too should
-- be considered to be resources that we should keep track of and deallocate
-- when they are no longer required, primarily because when we deallocate
-- (terminate) those threads they too will have a chance to deallocate /their/
-- resources. As for other resources, we have a with-style combinator for this
--
-- > withAsync $ \thread -> ..
--
-- Lexical scoping of threads is often inconvenient, however, more so than for
-- regular resources. The temptation is therefore to simply fork a thread and
-- forget about it, but if we are serious about resource deallocation this is
-- not an acceptable solution.
--
-- = The resource registry
--
-- The resource registry is essentially a piece of state tracking which
-- resources have been allocated. The registry itself is allocated with a
-- with-style combinator 'withRegistry', and when we leave that scope any
-- resources not yet deallocated will be released at that point. Typically
-- the registry is only used as a fall-back, ensuring that resources will
-- deallocated even in the presence of exceptions. For example, here's how
-- we might rewrite the above server example using a registry:
--
-- > server' :: IO ()
-- > server' =
-- >     withRegistry $ \registry -> go registry Map.empty
-- >   where
-- >     go :: ResourceRegistry IO
-- >        -> Map QueryId (ResourceKey, QueryHandle)
-- >        -> IO ()
-- >     go registry handles = getRequest >>= \case
-- >         New q -> do
-- >           (key, h) <- allocate registry (query q) close  -- allocate
-- >           qId      <- generateQueryId
-- >           sendResponse qId
-- >           go registry $ Map.insert qId (key, h) handles
-- >         Close qId -> do
-- >           release registry (fst (handles ! qId))         -- release
-- >           go registry $ Map.delete qId handles
-- >         Next qId -> do
-- >           sendResponse =<< next (snd (handles ! qId))
-- >           go registry handles
--
-- We allocate the query with the help of the registry, providing the registry
-- with the means to deallocate the query should that be required. We can /and
-- should/ still manually release resources also: in this particular example,
-- the (lexical) scope of the registry is the entire server thread, so delaying
-- releasing queries until we exit that scope will probably mean we hold on to
-- resources for too long. The registry is only there as a fall-back.
--
-- = Spawning threads
--
-- We already observed in the introduction that insisting on lexical scoping
-- for threads is often inconvenient, and that simply using 'fork' is no
-- solution as it means we might leak resources. There is however another
-- problem with 'fork'. Consider this snippet:
--
-- > withRegistry $ \registry ->
-- >   r <- allocate registry allocateResource releaseResource
-- >   fork $ .. use r ..
--
-- It is easy to see that this code is problematic: we allocate a resource @r@,
-- then spawn a thread that uses @r@, and finally leave the scope of
-- 'withRegistry', thereby deallocating @r@ -- leaving the thread to run with
-- a now deallocated resource.
--
-- It is /only/ safe for threads to use a given registry, and/or its registered
-- resources, if the lifetime of those threads is tied to the lifetime of the
-- registry. There would be no problem with the example above if the thread
-- would be terminated when we exit the scope of 'withRegistry'.
--
-- The 'forkThread' combinator provided by the registry therefore does two
-- things: it allocates the thread as a resource in the registry, so that it can
-- kill the thread when releasing all resources in the registry. It also records
-- the thread ID in a set of known threads. Whenever the registry is accessed
-- from a thread /not/ in this set, the registry throws a runtime exception,
-- since such a thread might outlive the registry and hence its contents. The
-- intention is that this guards against dangerous patterns like the one above.
--
-- = Linking
--
-- When thread A spawns thread B using 'withAsync', the lifetime of B is tied
-- to the lifetime of A:
--
-- > withAsync .. $ \threadB -> ..
--
-- After all, when A exits the scope of the 'withAsync', thread B will be
-- killed. The reverse is however not true: thread B can terminate before
-- thread A. It is often useful for thread A to be able to declare a dependency
-- on thread B: if B somehow fails, that is, terminates with an exception, we
-- want that exception to be rethrown in thread A as well. A can achieve this
-- by /linking/ to B:
--
-- > withAsync .. $ \threadB -> do
-- >   link threadB
-- >   ..
--
-- Linking a parent to a child is however of limited value if the lifetime of
-- the child is not limited by the lifetime of the parent. For example, if A
-- does
--
-- > threadB <- async $ ..
-- > link threadB
--
-- and A terminates before B does, any exception thrown by B might be send to a
-- thread that no longer exists. This is particularly problematic when we start
-- chaining threads: if A spawns-and-links-to B which spawns-and-links-to C, and
-- C throws an exception, perhaps the intention is that this gets rethrown to B,
-- and then rethrown to A, terminating all three threads; however, if B has
-- terminated before the exception is thrown, C will throw the exception to a
-- non-existent thread and A is never notified.
--
-- For this reason, the registry's 'linkToRegistry' combinator does not link the
-- specified to the thread calling 'linkToRegistry', but rather to the thread
-- that created the registry. After all, the lifetime of threads spawned with
-- 'forkThread' can certainly exceed the lifetime of their parent threads, but
-- the lifetime of /all/ threads spawned using the registry will be limited by
-- the scope of that registry, and hence the lifetime of the thread that created
-- it. So, when we call 'linkToRegistry', the exception will be thrown the
-- thread that created the registry, which (if not caught) will cause that that
-- to exit the scope of 'withRegistry', thereby terminating all threads in that
-- registry.
--
-- # Combining the registry and with-style allocation
--
-- The presence of a registry does not mean it /must/ be used. Whenever
-- 'bracket' is applicable, it can (and probably should) still be used. T
--
-- This includes 'withAsync': after all, 'withAsync' can't result in a child
-- thread that outlives its parent, so this is safe. In particular, if a parent
-- thread wants to link to a child thread /and handle any exceptions arising
-- from the link/, it should probably use `withAsync`:
--
-- > let handleLinkException :: ExceptionInLinkedThread -> m ()
-- >     handleLinkException = ..
-- > in handle handleLinkException $
-- >      withAsync codeInChild $ \child ->
-- >        ..
--
-- instead of
--
-- > handle handleLinkException $ do  -- PROBABLY NOT CORRECT!
-- >   child <- async codeInChild
-- >   ..
--
-- where the parent may exit the scope of the exception handler before the child
-- terminates. If the lifetime of the child cannot be limited to the lifetime of
-- the parent, the child should probably be linked to the registry instead and
-- the thread that spawned the registry should handle any exceptions.
--
-- Apart from `withAsync`, it is /also/ fine to includes nested calls to
-- 'withRegistry'. Since the lifetime of such a registry (and all resources
-- within) is tied to the thread calling 'withRegistry', which itself is tied to
-- the "parent registry" in which it was created, this creates a hierarchy of
-- registries. It is of course essential for compositionality that we should be
-- able to create local registries, but even if we do have easy access to a
-- parent regisry, creating a local one where possibly is useful as it limits
-- the scope of the resources created within, and hence their maximum lifetimes.

-- access to a resource which may be deallocated before that thread is
-- terminated. Of course, we can't detect all such situations (when the thread
-- merely uses a resource but does not allocate or release we can't tell), but
-- normally when we /do/ detect this we throw an exception.
--
-- This function should only be used if the above situation can be ruled out
-- or handled by other means.
