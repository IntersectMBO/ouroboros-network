-- | Resource registry
--
-- Note on terminology: when thread A forks thread B, we will say that thread A
-- is the " parent " and thread B is the " child ". No further relationship
-- between the two threads is implied by this terminology. In particular, note
-- that the child may outlive the parent. We will use "fork" and "spawn"
-- interchangeably.
--
-- = Motivation
--
-- Whenever we allocate resources, we must keep track of them so that we can
-- deallocate them when they are no longer required. The most important tool we
-- have to achieve this is 'bracket':
--
-- > bracket allocateResource releaseResource $ \r ->
-- >   .. use r ..
--
-- Often 'bracket' comes in the guise of a with-style combinator
--
-- > withResource $ \r ->
-- >   .. use r ..
--
-- Where this pattern is applicable, it should be used and there is no need to
-- use the 'ResourceRegistry'. However, 'bracket' introduces strict lexical
-- scoping: the resource is available inside the scope of the bracket, and
-- will be deallocated once we leave that scope. That pattern is sometimes
-- hard to use.
--
-- For example, suppose we have this interface to an SQL server
--
-- > query :: Query -> IO QueryHandle
-- > close :: QueryHandle -> IO ()
-- > next  :: QueryHandle -> IO Row
--
-- and suppose furthermore that we are writing a simple webserver that allows a
-- client to send multiple SQL queries, get rows from any open query, and close
-- queries when no longer required:
--
-- > server :: IO ()
-- > server = go Map.empty
-- >   where
-- >     go :: Map QueryId QueryHandle -> IO ()
-- >     go handles = getRequest >>= \case
-- >         New q -> do
-- >           h   <- query q                        -- allocate
-- >           qId <- generateQueryId
-- >           sendResponse qId
-- >           go $ Map.insert qId h handles
-- >         Close qId -> do
-- >           close (handles ! qId)                 -- release
-- >           go $ Map.delete qId handles
-- >         Next qId -> do
-- >           sendResponse =<< next (handles ! qId)
-- >           go handles
--
-- The server opens and closes query handles in response to client requests.
-- Restructuring this code to use 'bracket' would be awkward, but as it stands
-- this code does not ensure that resources get deallocated; for example, if
-- the server thread is killed ('killThread'), resources will be leaked.
--
-- Another, perhaps simpler, example is spawning threads. Threads too should
-- be considered to be resources that we should keep track of and deallocate
-- when they are no longer required, primarily because when we deallocate
-- (terminate) those threads they too will have a chance to deallocate /their/
-- resources. As for other resources, we have a with-style combinator for this
--
-- > withAsync $ \thread -> ..
--
-- Lexical scoping of threads is often inconvenient, however, more so than for
-- regular resources. The temptation is therefore to simply fork a thread and
-- forget about it, but if we are serious about resource deallocation this is
-- not an acceptable solution.
--
-- = The resource registry
--
-- The resource registry is essentially a piece of state tracking which
-- resources have been allocated. The registry itself is allocated with a
-- with-style combinator 'withRegistry', and when we leave that scope any
-- resources not yet deallocated will be released at that point. Typically
-- the registry is only used as a fall-back, ensuring that resources will
-- deallocated even in the presence of exceptions. For example, here's how
-- we might rewrite the above server example using a registry:
--
-- > server' :: IO ()
-- > server' =
-- >     withRegistry $ \registry -> go registry Map.empty
-- >   where
-- >     go :: ResourceRegistry IO
-- >        -> Map QueryId (ResourceKey, QueryHandle)
-- >        -> IO ()
-- >     go registry handles = getRequest >>= \case
-- >         New q -> do
-- >           (key, h) <- allocate registry (query q) close  -- allocate
-- >           qId      <- generateQueryId
-- >           sendResponse qId
-- >           go registry $ Map.insert qId (key, h) handles
-- >         Close qId -> do
-- >           release registry (fst (handles ! qId))         -- release
-- >           go registry $ Map.delete qId handles
-- >         Next qId -> do
-- >           sendResponse =<< next (snd (handles ! qId))
-- >           go registry handles
--
-- We allocate the query with the help of the registry, providing the registry
-- with the means to deallocate the query should that be required. We can /and
-- should/ still manually release resources also: in this particular example,
-- the (lexical) scope of the registry is the entire server thread, so delaying
-- releasing queries until we exit that scope will probably mean we hold on to
-- resources for too long. The registry is only there as a fall-back.
--
-- = Spawning threads
--
-- We already observed in the introduction that insisting on lexical scoping
-- for threads is often inconvenient, and that simply using 'fork' is no
-- solution as it means we might leak resources. There is however another
-- problem with 'fork'. Consider this snippet:
--
-- > withRegistry $ \registry ->
-- >   r <- allocate registry allocateResource releaseResource
-- >   fork $ .. use r ..
--
-- It is easy to see that this code is problematic: we allocate a resource @r@,
-- then spawn a thread that uses @r@, and finally leave the scope of
-- 'withRegistry', thereby deallocating @r@ -- leaving the thread to run with
-- a now deallocated resource.
--
-- It is /only/ safe for threads to use a given registry, and/or its registered
-- resources, if the lifetime of those threads is tied to the lifetime of the
-- registry. There would be no problem with the example above if the thread
-- would be terminated when we exit the scope of 'withRegistry'.
--
-- The 'forkThread' combinator provided by the registry therefore does two
-- things: it allocates the thread as a resource in the registry, so that it can
-- kill the thread when releasing all resources in the registry. It also records
-- the thread ID in a set of known threads. Whenever the registry is accessed
-- from a thread /not/ in this set, the registry throws a runtime exception,
-- since such a thread might outlive the registry and hence its contents. The
-- intention is that this guards against dangerous patterns like the one above.
--
-- = Linking
--
-- When thread A spawns thread B using 'withAsync', the lifetime of B is tied
-- to the lifetime of A:
--
-- > withAsync .. $ \threadB -> ..
--
-- After all, when A exits the scope of the 'withAsync', thread B will be
-- killed. The reverse is however not true: thread B can terminate before
-- thread A. It is often useful for thread A to be able to declare a dependency
-- on thread B: if B somehow fails, that is, terminates with an exception, we
-- want that exception to be rethrown in thread A as well. A can achieve this
-- by /linking/ to B:
--
-- > withAsync .. $ \threadB -> do
-- >   link threadB
-- >   ..
--
-- Linking a parent to a child is however of limited value if the lifetime of
-- the child is not limited by the lifetime of the parent. For example, if A
-- does
--
-- > threadB <- async $ ..
-- > link threadB
--
-- and A terminates before B does, any exception thrown by B might be send to a
-- thread that no longer exists. This is particularly problematic when we start
-- chaining threads: if A spawns-and-links-to B which spawns-and-links-to C, and
-- C throws an exception, perhaps the intention is that this gets rethrown to B,
-- and then rethrown to A, terminating all three threads; however, if B has
-- terminated before the exception is thrown, C will throw the exception to a
-- non-existent thread and A is never notified.
--
-- For this reason, the registry's 'linkToRegistry' combinator does not link the
-- specified to the thread calling 'linkToRegistry', but rather to the thread
-- that created the registry. After all, the lifetime of threads spawned with
-- 'forkThread' can certainly exceed the lifetime of their parent threads, but
-- the lifetime of /all/ threads spawned using the registry will be limited by
-- the scope of that registry, and hence the lifetime of the thread that created
-- it. So, when we call 'linkToRegistry', the exception will be thrown the
-- thread that created the registry, which (if not caught) will cause that that
-- to exit the scope of 'withRegistry', thereby terminating all threads in that
-- registry.
--
-- # Combining the registry and with-style allocation
--
-- It is perfectly possible (indeed, advisable) to use 'bracket' and
-- bracket-like allocation functions alongside the registry, but note that the
-- usual caveats with 'bracket' and forking threads still applies. In
-- particular, spawning threads inside the 'bracket' that make use of the
-- bracketed resource is problematic; this is of course true whether or not a
-- registry is used.
--
-- In principle this also includes 'withAsync'; however, since 'withAsync'
-- results in a thread that is not known to the registry, such a thread will not
-- be able to use the registry (the registry would throw an unknown thread
-- exception, as described above). For this purpose we provide 'withThread';
-- 'withThread' (as opposed to 'forkThread') should be used when a parent thread
-- wants to handle exceptions in the child thread; see 'withThread' for
-- detailed discussion.
--
-- It is /also/ fine to includes nested calls to 'withRegistry'. Since the
-- lifetime of such a registry (and all resources within) is tied to the thread
-- calling 'withRegistry', which itself is tied to the "parent registry" in
-- which it was created, this creates a hierarchy of registries. It is of course
-- essential for compositionality that we should be able to create local
-- registries, but even if we do have easy access to a parent regisry, creating
-- a local one where possibly is useful as it limits the scope of the resources
-- created within, and hence their maximum lifetimes.

  Temporary registry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

-- | Run an action with a temporary resource registry.
--
-- When allocating resources that are meant to end up in some final state,
-- e.g., stored in a 'TVar', after which they are guaranteed to be released
-- correctly, it is possible that an exception is thrown after allocating such
-- a resource, but before it was stored in the final state. In that case, the
-- resource would be leaked. 'runWithTempRegistry' solves that problem.
--
-- When no exception is thrown before the end of 'runWithTempRegistry', the
-- user must have transferred all the resources it allocated to their final
-- state. This means that these resources don't have to be released by the
-- temporary registry anymore, the final state is now in charge of releasing
-- them.
--
-- In case an exception is thrown before the end of 'runWithTempRegistry',
-- /all/ resources allocated in the temporary registry will be released.
--
-- Resources must be allocated using 'allocateTemp'.
--
-- To make sure that the user doesn't forget to transfer a resource to the
-- final state @st@, the user must pass a function to 'allocateTemp' that
-- checks whether a given @st@ contains the resource, i.e., whether the
-- resource was successfully transferred to its final destination.
--
-- When no exception is thrown before the end of 'runWithTempRegistry', we
-- check whether all allocated resources have been transferred to the final
-- state @st@. If there's a resource that hasn't been transferred to the final
-- state /and/ that hasn't be released or closed before (see the release
-- function passed to 'allocateTemp'), a 'TempRegistryRemainingResource'
-- exception will be thrown.
--
-- For that reason, 'WithTempRegistry' is parameterised over the final state
-- type @st@ and the given 'WithTempRegistry' action must return the final
-- state.
--
-- NOTE: we explicitly don't let 'runWithTempRegistry' return the final state,
-- because the state /must/ have been stored somewhere safely, transferring
-- the resources, before the temporary registry is closed.

-- | Bracketed version of 'forkThread'
--
-- The analogue of 'withAsync' for the registry.
--
-- Scoping thread lifetime using 'withThread' is important when a parent
-- thread wants to link to a child thread /and handle any exceptions arising
-- from the link/:
--
-- > let handleLinkException :: ExceptionInLinkedThread -> m ()
-- >     handleLinkException = ..
-- > in handle handleLinkException $
-- >      withThread registry codeInChild $ \child ->
-- >        ..
--
-- instead of
--
-- > handle handleLinkException $ do  -- PROBABLY NOT CORRECT!
-- >   child <- forkThread registry codeInChild
-- >   ..
--
-- where the parent may exit the scope of the exception handler before the child
-- terminates. If the lifetime of the child cannot be limited to the lifetime of
-- the parent, the child should probably be linked to the registry instead and
-- the thread that spawned the registry should handle any exceptions.
--
-- Note that in /principle/ there is no problem in using 'withAync' alongside a
-- registry. After all, in a pattern like
--
-- > withRegistry $ \registry ->
-- >   ..
-- >   withAsync (.. registry ..) $ \async ->
-- >     ..
--
-- the async will be cancelled when leaving the scope of 'withAsync' and so
-- that reference to the registry, or indeed any of the resources inside the
-- registry, is safe. However, the registry implements a sanity check that the
-- registry is only used from known threads. This is useful: when a thread that
-- is not known to the registry (in other words, whose lifetime is not tied to
-- the lifetime of the registry) spawns a resource in that registry, that
-- resource may well be deallocated before the thread terminates, leading to
-- undefined and hard to debug behaviour (indeed, whether or not this results in
-- problems may well depend on precise timing); an exception that is thrown when
-- /allocating/ the resource is (more) deterministic and easier to debug.
-- Unfortunately, it means that the above pattern is not applicable, as the
-- thread spawned by 'withAsync' is not known to the registry, and so if it were
-- to try to use the registry, the registry would throw an error (even though
-- this pattern is actually safe). This situation is not ideal, but for now we
-- merely provide an alternative to 'withAsync' that /does/ register the thread
-- with the registry.
--
-- NOTE: Threads that are spawned out of the user's control but that must still
-- make use of the registry can use the unsafe API. This should be used with
-- caution, however.
