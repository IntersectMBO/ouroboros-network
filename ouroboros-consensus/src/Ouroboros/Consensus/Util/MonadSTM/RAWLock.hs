-- | A Read-Append-Write (RAW) lock
--
-- A RAW lock allows multiple concurrent readers, at most one appender, which
-- is allowed to run concurrently with the readers, and at most one writer,
-- which has exclusive access to the lock.
--
-- The following table summarises which roles are allowed to concurrently
-- access the RAW lock:
--
-- >          │ Reader │ Appender │ Writer │
-- > ─────────┼────────┼──────────┼────────┤
-- > Reader   │   V    │     V    │    X   │
-- > Appender │░░░░░░░░│     X    │    X   │
-- > Writer   │░░░░░░░░│░░░░░░░░░░│    X   │
--
-- It is important to realise that a RAW lock is intended to control access to
-- a piece of in-memory state that should remain in sync with some other state
-- that can only be modified using side-effects, e.g., the file system. If,
-- for example, you're only maintaining a counter shared by threads, then
-- simply use a 'TVar' or an 'MVar'.
--
-- = Example use case: log files
--
-- A RAW lock is useful, for example, to maintain an in-memory index of log
-- files stored on disk.
--
-- * To read data from a log file, you need \"read\" access to the index to
--   find out the file and offset where the requested piece of data is stored.
--   While holding the RAW lock as a reader, you can perform the IO operation
--   to read the data from the right log file. This can safely happen
--   concurrently with other read operations.
--
-- * To append data to the current log file, you need \"append\" access to the
--   index so you can append an entry to the index and even to add a new log
--   file to the index when necessary. While holding the RAW lock as an
--   appender, you can perform the IO operation to append the piece of data to
--   the current log file and, if necessary start a new log file. Only one
--   append can happen concurrently. However, reads can safely happen
--   concurrently with appends. Note that the in-memory index is only updated
--   /after/ writing to disk.
--
-- * To remove the oldest log files, you need \"write\" access to the index,
--   so you can remove files from the index. While holding the RAW lock as a
--   writer, you can perform the IO operations to delete the oldest log files.
--   No other operations can run concurrently with this operation: concurrent
--   reads might try to read from deleted files and a concurrent append could
--   try to append to a deleted file.
--
-- = Analogy: Chicken coop
--
-- Think of readers as chickens, the appender as the rooster, and the writer
-- as the fox. All of them want access to the chicken coop, i.e., the state
-- protected by the RAW lock.
--
-- We can allow multiple chickens (readers) together in the chicken coop, they
-- get along (reasonably) fine. We can also let one rooster (appender) in, but
-- not more than one, otherwise he would start fighting with the other rooster
-- (conflict with the other appender). We can only let the fox in when all
-- chickens and the rooster (if present) have left the chicken coop, otherwise
-- the fox would eat them (conflict with the appender and invalidate the
-- results of readers, e.g, closing resources readers try to access).
--
-- = Usage
--
-- To use the lock, use any of the three following operations:
--
-- * 'withReadAccess'
-- * 'withAppendAccess'
-- * 'withWriteAccess'
--
-- If the standard bracketing the above three operations use doesn't suffice,
-- use the following three acquire-release pairs:
--
-- * 'unsafeAcquireReadAccess'   & 'unsafeReleaseReadAccess'
-- * 'unsafeAcquireAppendAccess' & 'unsafeReleaseAppendAccess'
-- * 'unsafeAcquireWriteAccess'  & 'unsafeReleaseWriteAccess'
--
-- NOTE: an acquire __must__ be followed by the corresponding release,
-- otherwise the correctness of the lock is not guaranteed and a dead-lock can
-- happen.
--
-- NOTE: nested locking of the same lock is not allowed, as you might be
-- blocked on yourself.
--
-- = Notes
--
-- * Only use a RAW lock when it is safe to concurrently read and append.
--
-- * We do not guarantee fairness for appenders and writers. They will race
--   for access each time the RAW lock changes.
--
-- * When you have many writers and/or very frequent writes, readers and
--   appenders will starve. You could say we have \"unfairness\", as writers
--   win over readers and appenders. A RAW lock will not be the best fit in
--   such a scenario.
--
-- * When you have no writers and you only need a read-append lock, consider
--   using a @StrictMVar@ instead. The \"stale\" state can be used by the
--   readers.
--
-- * The state @st@ is always evaluated to WHNF and is subject to the
--   'NoThunks' check when enabled.
--
-- * All public functions are exception-safe.
