-- | Compute the upper bound for a range for a forecast across eras.
--
-- We have to be very careful here in how we compute the maximum lookahead.
-- As long as we are in a single era, things look like this:
--
-- >                                          /-------------------\
-- >                                          |                   |
-- > chain     ... - block - block - block [block]                |
-- >                                   |                          v
-- > ledger                           TIP                  VIEW
--
-- where @TIP@ is the current ledger tip and @VIEW@ is the last ledger view we
-- can forecast, because the next block @[block]@ to arrive will take effect in
-- the next leger state after @VIEW@. Note that if the maximum lookahead is
-- zero, this looks like
--
-- > chain     ... - block - block - block [block]
-- >                                   |      |
-- > ledger                           TIP
--
-- where @[block]@ can have immediate changes on the ledger, and so we can't
-- look ahead at all (of course, we always know the /current/ @TIP@).
--
-- Note that blocks arriving /after/ @[block]@ can only take effect /later/ than
-- @[block]@, and so they are not relevant for computing the maximum slot number
-- we can compute a ledger view for.
--
-- Now, if we are near an era transition, this picture gets a bit more
-- complicated. /If/ the next block is still in this era (that is, unless we are
-- /right/ at the edge), then that imposes /one/ constraint, as before. However,
-- the first block in the /next/ era imposes an /additional/ constraint:
--
-- >                      ~
-- >                      ~    /------------------\
-- >                      ~    |                  |
-- >          /---------- ~ ---|----------\       |
-- >          |           ~    |          |       |
-- > block [block]        ~ [block']      |       |
-- >   |                  ~               v       v
-- >  TIP                 ~         VIEW
-- >                      ~
--
-- There are no restrictions on the relative values of these two maximum
-- lookahead values. This means that it's quite possible for the next era to
-- have a /smaller/ lookahead (to re-iterate, since that era has not yet begun,
-- the first block in that era is at the transition, and so the maximum
-- lookahead applies from the transition point):
--
-- >                      ~
-- >                      ~    /----------\
-- >                      ~    |          |
-- >          /---------- ~ ---|----------|-------\
-- >          |           ~    |          |       |
-- > block [block]        ~ [block']      |       |
-- >   |                  ~               v       v
-- >  TIP                 ~         VIEW
-- >                      ~
--
-- Indeed, if the next era has zero lookahead, when the first block of the next
-- era comes it, it can make changes immediately, and so we can't even know what
-- the view at the transition point is.
--
-- Note that if there can be no more blocks in this era, the maximum lookahead
-- of the current era is irrelevant:
--
-- >       ~
-- >       ~    /----------\
-- >       ~    |          |
-- >       ~    |          |
-- >       ~    |          |
-- > block ~ [block']      |
-- >   |   ~               v
-- >  TIP  ~         VIEW
-- >       ~
--
-- We can therefore compute the earliest 'SlotNo' the next block in this era
-- (if any) can make changes to the ledger state, as well as the earliest
-- 'SlotNo' the first block in the next era can; their @minimum@ will serve as
-- an exclusive upper bound for the forecast range.
