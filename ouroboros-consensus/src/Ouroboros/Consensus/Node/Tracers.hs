    --     VolatileDB since it's all in the future, and now the tip of the

    -- to forge.
    --
    -- We record the current slot number, the block number of the block to
    -- connect to and its point.
    --
    -- Note that block number of the block we will try to forge is one more than
    -- the recorded block number.
  | TraceBlockContext SlotNo BlockNo (Point blk)

    -- | Leadership check failed: we were unable to get the ledger state for the
    -- point of the block we want to connect to
    --
    -- This can happen if after choosing which block to connect to the node
    -- switched to a different fork. We expect this to happen only rather
    -- rarely, so this certainly merits a warning; if it happens a lot, that
    -- merits an investigation.
    --
    -- We record both the current slot number as well as the point of the block
    -- we attempt to connect the new block to (that we requested the ledger
    -- state for).
  | TraceNoLedgerState SlotNo (Point blk)

    -- | We obtained a ledger state for the point of the block we want to
    -- connect to
    --
    -- We record both the current slot number as well as the point of the block
    -- we attempt to connect the new block to (that we requested the ledger
    -- state for).
  | TraceLedgerState SlotNo (Point blk)

    -- | Leadership check failed: we were unable to get the ledger view for the
    -- current slot number
    --
    -- This will only happen if there are many missing blocks between the tip of
    -- our chain and the current slot.
    --

    -- | We obtained a ledger view for the current slot number

    --
    -- For example, the KES key could not be evolved anymore.
    --
    -- We record the error returned by 'updateForgeState'.
  | TraceForgeStateUpdateError SlotNo (ForgeStateUpdateError blk)

    -- | We did the leadership check and concluded that we should lead and forge
    -- a block, but cannot.

  | TraceNodeNotLeader SlotNo

    -- | We did the leadership check and concluded we /are/ the leader
    --
    -- The node will soon forge; it is about to read its transactions from the
    -- Mempool. This will be followed by TraceForgedBlock.
  | TraceNodeIsLeader SlotNo

    -- | We ticked the ledger state for the slot of the to-be-forged block.
    --
    -- We record the current slot number and the point of the block we attempt
    -- to connect the new block to.
  | TraceForgeTickedLedgerState SlotNo (Point blk)

    -- | We acquired a mempool snapshot.
    --
    -- We record the the point of the state we are starting from (ie the point
    -- from 'TraceLedgerState') and point the mempool had most last synced wrt.
  | TraceForgingMempoolSnapshot SlotNo (Point blk) (ChainHash blk) SlotNo

    -- | We forged a block
    --
    -- We record the current slot number, the point of the predecessor, the block
    -- itself, and the total size of the mempool snapshot at the time we produced
    -- the block (which may be significantly larger than the block, due to
    -- maximum block size)
    --
    -- This will be followed by one of three messages:
    --
    -- * TraceAdoptedBlock (normally)
    -- * TraceDidntAdoptBlock (rarely)
    -- * TraceForgedInvalidBlock (hopefully never -- this would indicate a bug)
  | TraceForgedBlock SlotNo (Point blk) blk MempoolSize

    -- | We did not adopt the block we produced, but the block was valid. We
    -- must have adopted a block that another leader of the same slot produced
    -- before we got the chance of adopting our own block. This is very rare,
    -- this warrants a warning.
  | TraceDidntAdoptBlock SlotNo blk

    -- | We did not adopt the block we produced, because the adoption thread
    -- died.  Most likely because of an async exception.
  | TraceAdoptionThreadDied SlotNo blk

    -- | We forged a block that is invalid according to the ledger in the
    -- ChainDB. This means there is an inconsistency between the mempool
    -- validation and the ledger validation. This is a serious error!
