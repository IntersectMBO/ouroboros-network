data TraceForgeEvent blk tx
  -- | Start of the leadership check
  --
  -- We record the current slot number.
  --
  -- This event terminates with one of the following concluding trace messages:
  --
  -- * TraceNodeNotLeader if we are not the leader
  -- * TraceNodeIsLeader if we are the leader
  -- * TraceBlockFromFuture (rarely)
  -- * TraceNoLedgerState (rarely)
  -- * TraceNoLedgerView (rarely)
  = TraceStartLeadershipCheck SlotNo

  -- | We did the leadership check and concluded we are not the leader
  --
  -- We record the current slot number
  | TraceNodeNotLeader SlotNo

  -- | Leadership check failed: we were unable to get the ledger state
  -- for the point of the block we want to connect to
  --
  -- This can happen if after choosing which block to connect to the node
  -- switched to a different fork. We expect this to happen only rather rarely,
  -- so this certainly merits a warning; if it happens a lot, that merits an
  -- investigation.
  --
  -- We record both the current slot number as well as the point of the block
  -- we attempt to connect the new block to (that we requested the ledger state
  -- for).
  | TraceNoLedgerState SlotNo (Point blk)

  -- | Leadership check failed: we were unable to get the ledger view for the
  -- current slot number
  --
  -- This will only happen if there are many missing blocks between the tip of
  -- our chain and the current slot.
  --
  -- As a sanity check, we record also the failure returned by
  -- 'anachronisticProtocolLedgerView', although we expect this to be
  -- 'TooFarAhead', never 'TooFarBehind'.
  | TraceNoLedgerView SlotNo AnachronyFailure

  -- | Leadership check failed: the current chain contains a block from a slot
  -- /after/ the current slot
  --
  -- This can only happen if the system is under heavy load.
  --
  -- We record both the current slot number as well as the slot number of the
  -- block at the tip of the chain.
  --
  -- See also <https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1462>
  | TraceBlockFromFuture SlotNo SlotNo

  -- | We did the leadership check and concluded we /are/ the leader
  --
  -- The node will soon forge; it is about to read its transactions and
  -- current DB. This will be followed by TraceForgedBlock.
  | TraceNodeIsLeader SlotNo

  -- | We forged a block
  --
  -- We record the current slot number, the block itself, and the total size
  -- of the mempool snapshot at the time we produced the block (which may be
  -- significantly larger than the block, due to maximum block size)
  --
  -- This will be followed by one of three messages:
  --
  -- * TraceAdoptedBlock (normally)
  -- * TraceDidntAdoptBlock (rarely)
  -- * TraceForgedInvalidBlock (hopefully never -- this would indicate a bug)
  | TraceForgedBlock SlotNo blk MempoolSize

  -- | We adopted the block we produced, we also trace the transactions
  -- that were adopted.
  | TraceAdoptedBlock SlotNo blk [tx]

  -- | We did not adopt the block we produced, but the block was valid. We
  -- must have adopted a block that another leader of the same slot produced
  -- before we got the chance of adopting our own block. This is very rare,
  -- this warrants a warning.
  | TraceDidntAdoptBlock SlotNo blk

  -- | We forged a block that is invalid according to the ledger in the
  -- ChainDB. This means there is an inconsistency between the mempool
  -- validation and the ledger validation. This is a serious error!
