-- | The chain database
--
-- The chain database provides a unified interface on top of:
--
-- * The ImmutableDB, storing the part of the chain that can't roll back.
-- * The VolatileDB, storing the blocks near the tip of the chain, possibly in
--   multiple competing forks.
-- * The LedgerDB, storing snapshots of the ledger state for blocks in the
--   ImmutableDB (and in-memory snapshots for the rest).
--
-- In addition to providing a unifying interface on top of these disparate
-- components, the main responsibilities that the ChainDB itself has are:
--
-- * Chain selection (on initialization and whenever a block is added)
-- * Trigger full recovery whenever we detect disk failure in any component
-- * Provide iterators across fixed fragments of the current chain
-- * Provide followers that track the status of the current chain
--
-- The ChainDB instantiates all the various type parameters of these databases
-- to conform to the unified interface we provide here.

      -- Conversely, the caller cannot assume that the new block will be added
      -- to the current chain; even if the block is valid, it will not become
      -- part of the chain if there are other chains available that are
      -- preferred by the consensus algorithm (typically, longer chains).

      -- | Stream blocks
      --
      -- Streaming is not restricted to the current fork, but there must be an
      -- unbroken path from the starting point to the end point /at the time
      -- of initialization/ of the iterator. Once the iterator has been
      -- initialized, it will not be affected by subsequent calls to
      -- 'addBlock'. To track the current chain, use a 'Follower' instead.
      --
      -- Streaming blocks older than @k@ is permitted, but only when they are
      -- part of the current fork (at the time of initialization). Streaming a
      -- fork that forks off more than @k@ blocks in the past is not permitted
      -- and an 'UnknownRange' error will be returned in that case.
      --
      -- The iterator /does/ have a limited lifetime, however. The chain DB
      -- internally partitions the chain into an " immutable " part and a
      -- " volatile " part, moving blocks from the volatile DB to the immutable
      -- DB when they become more than @k@ deep into the chain. When a block
      -- with slot number @n@ is added to the immutble DB, a time delay @t@
      -- kicks in; after that time delay expires, all blocks older than @n@ may
      -- be removed from the volatile DB, /including any blocks that happen to
      -- live on other forks/ (since those forks must now, by definition, be too
      -- distant). This time delay @t@ also provides a worst-case bound for the
      -- lifetime of the iterator: if the iterator traverses a chain that
      -- forks off from our current chain at the tip of the immutable DB,
      -- then the first block on that fork will become unavailable as soon as
      -- another block is pushed to the current chain and the subsequent
      -- time delay expires.
      --
      -- Note: although blocks are moved from the volatile DB to the immutable
      -- DB after they have become @k@ deep into the chain, due to data
      -- corruption the suffix of the chain in the volatile DB might be
      -- shorter than @k@. The immutable DB /always/ determines the maximum
      -- rollback, which may therefore be shorter than @k@ under such
      -- circumstances. In addition, streaming blocks which aren't on the
      -- current fork is permitted, but the oldest volatile block must fit on
      -- to the tip of the immutable DB.
      --
      -- When the given bounds are nonsensical, an 'InvalidIteratorRange' is
      -- thrown.
      --
      -- When the given bounds are not part of the chain DB, an 'UnknownRange'
      -- error is returned.
