-- | Stream blocks
--
-- = Start & end point
--
-- The start point can either be in the ImmutableDB (on our chain) or in the
-- VolatileDB (on our chain or on a recent fork). We first check whether it is
-- in the VolatileDB, if not, we check if it is in the ImmutableDB (see
-- \"Garbage collection\" for why this order is important). Similarly for the
-- end point.
--
-- If a bound can't be found in the ChainDB, an 'UnknownRange' error is
-- returned.
--
-- When the bounds are nonsensical, e.g.,
-- > StreamFromExclusive (Point { pointSlot = SlotNo 3 , .. }
-- > StreamToInclusive   (Point { pointSlot = SlotNo 3 , .. }
-- An 'InvalidIteratorRange' exception is thrown.
--
-- = Paths of blocks
--
-- To stream blocks from the ImmutableDB we can simply use the iterators
-- offered by the ImmutableDB.
--
-- To stream blocks from the VolatileDB we have to construct a path of points
-- backwards through the VolatileDB, starting from the end point using
-- 'getPredecessor' until we get to the start point, genesis, or we get to a
-- block that is not in the VolatileDB. Then, for each point in the path, we
-- can ask the VolatileDB for the corresponding block.
--
-- If the path through the VolatileDB is incomplete, we will first have to
-- stream blocks from the ImmutableDB and then switch to the path through the
-- VolatileDB. We only allow the tip of the ImmutableDB to be the switchover
-- point between the two DBs. In other words, the incomplete path through the
-- VolatileDB must fit onto the tip of the ImmutableDB. This must be true at
-- the time of initialising the iterator, but does not have to hold during the
-- whole lifetime of the iterator. If it doesn't fit on it, it means the path
-- forked off more than @k@ blocks in the past and blocks belonging to it are
-- more likely to go missing because of garbage-collection (see the next
-- paragraph). In that case, we return 'ForkTooOld'.
--
-- = Garbage collection
--
-- We have to be careful about the following: as our chain grows, blocks from
-- our chain will be copied to the ImmutableDB in the background. After a
-- while, old blocks will be garbage-collected from the VolatileDB. Blocks
-- that were part of the current chain will be in the ImmutableDB, but blocks
-- that only lived on forks will be gone forever.
--
-- This means that blocks that were part of the VolatileDB when the iterator
-- was initialised might no longer be part of the VolatileDB when we come to
-- the point that the iterator will try to read them. When this is noticed, we
-- will try to open an iterator from the ImmutableDB to obtain the blocks that
-- have moved over. However, this will only work if they were and are part of
-- the current chain, otherwise they will have been deleted from the
-- VolatileDB without being copied to the ImmutableDB.
--
-- This iterator is opened with an open upper bound and will be used to stream
-- blocks until the path has been fully streamed, the iterator is exhausted,
-- or a block doesn't match the expected point. In the latter two cases, we
-- switch back to the VolatileDB. If the block is missing from the VolatileDB,
-- we will switch back to streaming from the ImmutableDB. If that fails, we
-- switch back to the VolatileDB. To avoid eternally switching between the two
-- DBs, we only switch back to the VolatileDB if the stream from the
-- ImmutableDB has made progress, i.e. streamed at least one block with the
-- expected point. If no block was streamed from the ImmutableDB, not even the
-- first one, we know for sure that that block isn't part of the VolatileDB
-- (the reason we switch to the ImmutableDB) and isn't part of the ImmutableDB
-- (no block was streamed). In that case, we return 'IteratorBlockGCed' and
-- stop the stream.
--
-- Note that the open upper bound doesn't allow us to include blocks in the
-- stream that are copied to the ImmutableDB after opening this iterator, as
-- the bound of the iterator is fixed upon initialisation. These newly added
-- blocks will be included in the stream because we will repeatedly open new
-- ImmutableDB iterators (as long as we make progress).
--
-- = Bounds checking
--
-- The VolatileDB is hash-based instead of point-based. While the bounds of a
-- stream are /point/s, we can simply check whether the hashes of the bounds
-- match the hashes stored in the points.
--
-- The ImmutableDB is slot-based instead of point-based, which means that
-- before we know whether a block in the ImmutableDB matches a given point, we
-- must first read the block's hash corresponding to the point's slot from the
-- (cached) on-disk indices, after which we can then verify whether it matches
-- the hash of the point. This is important for the start and end bounds (both
-- points) of a stream in case they are in the ImmutableDB (i.e., their slots
-- are <= the tip of the ImmutableDB): we must first read the hashes
-- corresponding to the bounds from the (cached) on-disk indices to be sure
-- the range is valid. Note that these reads happen before the first call to
-- 'iteratorNext'.
--
-- Note that when streaming to an /exclusive/ bound, the block corresponding
-- to that bound ('Point') must exist in the ChainDB.
--
-- The ImmutableDB will keep the on-disk indices of a chunk of blocks in
-- memory after the first read so that the next lookup doesn't have to read
-- from disk. When both bounds are in the same chunk, which will typically be
-- the case, only checking the first bound will require disk reads, the second
-- will be cached.
--
-- = Costs
--
-- Opening an iterator has some costs:
--
-- * When blocks have to be streamed from the ImmutableDB: as discussed in
--   \"Bounds checking\", the hashes corresponding to the bounds have to be
--   read from the (cached) on-disk indices.
--
-- * When blocks have to be streamed both from the ImmutableDB and the
--   VolatileDB, only the hash of the block corresponding to the lower bound
--   will have to be read from the ImmutableDB upfront, as described in the
--   previous bullet point. Note that the hash of the block corresponding to
--   the upper bound does not have to be read from disk, since it will be in
--   the VolatileDB, which means that we know its hash already from the
--   in-memory index.
--
-- * When an exclusive lower bound requires streaming from the ImmutableDB,
--   the block corresponding to that lower bound is read from disk (if the
--   passed 'BlockComponent' requires reading from disk) because the
--   ImmutableDB doesn't support exclusive bounds. There is no such cost
--   attached to an exclusive upper bound. See #548.
--
-- In summary:
--
-- * Only streaming from the VolatileDB: 0 (cached) reads from disk upfront.
-- * Only streaming from the ImmutableDB: 2 (cached) reads from disk upfront +
--   1 block read from disk upfront in case of an exclusive lower bound.
-- * Streaming from both the ImmutableDB and the VolatileDB: 1 (cached) read
--   from disk upfront + 1 block read from disk upfront in case of an
--   exclusive lower bound.
--
-- Additionally, when we notice during streaming that a block is no longer in
-- the VolatileDB, we try to see whether it can be streamed from the
-- ImmutableDB instead. Opening such an iterator costs 2 (cached) reads from
-- disk upfront and 1 block read from disk upfront as it uses an exclusive
-- lower bound. This can happen multiple times.

--
-- When streaming solely from the VolatileDB ('InVolDB'): when
-- 'VolDB.getBlock' returns 'Nothing', i.e. the block is missing from the
-- VolatileDB and might have moved to the ImmutableDB: we switch to the
-- 'InImmDBRetry' state, unless we just come from that state, in that case,

-- VolatileDB ('InImmDB' where 'InImmDBEnd' is 'SwitchToVolDBFrom') and we
-- have reached the end of the ImmutableDB iterator (exhausted or upper bound
-- is reached): we switch to the 'InVolDB' state.
--
-- In the 'InImmDBRetry' state, we distinguish two cases:
--
-- 1. We have just switched to it because a block was missing from the
--    VolatileDB. We have an iterator that could stream this block from the
--    ImmutableDB (if it was indeed moved to the ImmutableDB). If the streamed
--    block matches the expected point, we continue. If not, or if the
--    iterator is immediately exhausted, then the block is missing and we
--    return 'IteratorBlockGCed' and close the iterator.
--
-- 2. We have successfully streamed one or more blocks from the ImmutableDB
--    that were previously part of the VolatileDB. When we now encounter a
--    block of which the point does not match the expected point or when the
--    iterator is exhausted, we switch back to the 'InVolDB' state.
