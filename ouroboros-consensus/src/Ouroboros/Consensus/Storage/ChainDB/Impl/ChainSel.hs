--
-- When the queue is full, this function will still block.
--
-- An important advantage of this asynchronous approach over a synchronous
-- approach is that it doesn't have the following disadvantage: when a thread
-- adding a block to the ChainDB is killed, which can happen when
-- disconnecting from the corresponding node, we might have written the block
-- to disk, but not updated the corresponding in-memory state (e.g., that of
-- the VolatileDB), leaving both out of sync.
--
-- With this asynchronous approach, threads adding blocks asynchronously can
-- be killed without worries, the background thread processing the blocks
-- synchronously won't be killed. Only when the whole ChainDB shuts down will
-- that background thread get killed. But since there will be no more
-- in-memory state, it can't get out of sync with the file system state. On
-- the next startup, a correct in-memory state will be reconstructed from the

-- blocks from disk and extract their headers. Under normal circumstances this
-- does not matter too much; although this will be done every time we add a
-- block, the expected number of headers to read from disk is very small:
--
-- * None if we stay on the current chain and this is just the next block
-- * A handful if we stay on the current chain and the block we just received
--   was a missing block and we already received some of its successors
-- * A handful if we switch to a short fork
--
-- This is expensive only
--
-- * on startup: in this case we need to read at least @k@ blocks from the
--   VolatileDB, and possibly more if there are some other chains in the
--   VolatileDB starting from the tip of the ImmutableDB
-- * when we switch to a distant fork
--
