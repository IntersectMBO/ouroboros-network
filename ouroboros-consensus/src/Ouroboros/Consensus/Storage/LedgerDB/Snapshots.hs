  = Snapshot managing and contents

  Snapshotting a ledger state means saving a copy of the in-memory part of the
  ledger state serialized as a file on disk, as well as flushing differences on
  the ledger tables between the last snapshotted ledger state and the one that
  we are snapshotting now and making a copy of that resulting on-disk state.

  == Startup

  On startup, the node will:

  1. Find the latest snapshot which will be a directory identified by the slot
     number of the snapshot:

        > <cardano-node data dir>
        > ├── volatile
        > ├── immutable
        > └── ledger
        >     ├── <slotNumber1>
        >     │   ├── tables
        >     │   └── state
        >     ├── <slotNumber2>
        >     │   ├── tables
        >     │   └── state
        >     └── <slotNumber3>
        >         ├── tables
        >         └── state

  2. Depending on the snapshots found, there are two possibilities:

       - If there is no snapshot to load, create a new @'BackingStore'@ with the
         contents of the Genesis UTxO and finish.

       - If there is a snapshot found, then deserialize the @state@ file, which
         contains a serialization of the in-memory part of the LedgerState, with
         an empty UTxO map (i.e. a @ExtLedgerState blk EmptyMK@).

        In case we found an snapshot, we will overwrite (either literally
        overwriting it or using some feature the specific backend used) the
        @BackingStore@ tables with the @tables@ file from said snapshot as it
        was left in whatever state it was when the node shut down.

  3. The deserialized ledger state will be then used as the anchor for the
     ledger database.

  4. Replay on top of this ledger database all blocks up to the immutable
     database tip.

  At this point, the node carries a @LedgerDB@ that is initialized and ready to
  be applied blocks on the volatile database.

  == Taking snapshots during normal operation

  Snapshots are taken by the @'copyAndSnapshotRunner'@ when the disk policy
  dictates to do so. Whenever the chain grows past @k@ blocks, said runner will
  copy the blocks which are more than @k@ blocks from the tip (i.e. the ones
  that must be considered immutable) to the immutable database and then:

  1. Every time we have processed a specific amount of blocks since the last
     flush (currently statically set to 100, but ideally will be lifted into
     some configuration parameter), perform a flush of differences in the DB up
     to the immutable db tip.

  2. If dictated by the disk policy, flush immediately all the differences up to
     the immutable db tip and serialize the ledger database anchor
     @ExtLedgerState blk EmptyMK@.

     A directory is created named after the slot number of the ledger state
     being snapshotted, and the serialization from above is written into the
     @\<slotNumber\>/state@ file and the @BackingStore@ tables are copied into
     the @\<slotNumber\>/tables@ file.

  3. There is a maximum number of snapshots that should exist in the disk at any
     time, dictated by the @DiskPolicy@, so if needed, we will trim out old
     snapshots.

  == Flush during startup and snapshot at the end of startup

  Due to the nature of the database having to carry around all the differences
  between the last snapshotted state and the current tip, there is a need to
  flush when replaying the chain as otherwise, for example on a replay from
  genesis to the tip, we would carry millions of differences in memory.

  Because of this, when we are replaying blocks we will flush regularly. As the
  last snapshot that was taken lives in a @\<slotNumber\>/tables@ file, there is
  no risk of destroying it (overwriting tables at another earlier snapshot) by
  flushing. Only when we finish replaying blocks and start the background
  threads (and specifically the @copyAndSnapshotRunner@), we will take a
  snapshot of the current immutable database anchor as described above.
