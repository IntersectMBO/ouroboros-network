-- | Initialize the ledger DB from the most recent snapshot on disk
--
-- If no such snapshot can be found, use the genesis ledger DB. Returns the
-- initialized DB as well as the block reference corresponding to the snapshot
-- we found on disk (the latter primarily for testing/monitoring purposes).
--
-- We do /not/ catch any exceptions thrown during streaming; should any be
-- thrown, it is the responsibility of the 'ChainDB' to catch these
-- and trigger (further) validation. We only discard snapshots if
--
-- * We cannot deserialise them, or
-- * they are /ahead/ of the chain
--
-- It is possible that the Ledger DB will not be able to roll back @k@ blocks
-- after initialization if the chain has been truncated (data corruption).
--
-- We do /not/ attempt to use multiple ledger states from disk to construct the
-- ledger DB. Instead we load only a /single/ ledger state from disk, and
-- /compute/ all subsequent ones. This is important, because the ledger states
-- obtained in this way will (hopefully) share much of their memory footprint
-- with their predecessors.
