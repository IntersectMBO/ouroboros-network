-- | On-disk policy

-- We only write ledger states that are older than @k@ blocks to disk (that is,
-- snapshots that are guaranteed valid). The on-disk policy determines how often
-- we write to disk and how many checkpoints we keep.

      -- | How many snapshots do we want to keep on disk?
      --
      -- A higher number of on-disk snapshots is primarily a safe-guard against
      -- disk corruption: it trades disk space for reliability.
      --
      -- Examples:
      --
      -- * @0@: Delete the snapshot immediately after writing.
      --        Probably not a useful value :-D
      -- * @1@: Delete the previous snapshot immediately after writing the next
      --        Dangerous policy: if for some reason the deletion happens before
      --        the new snapshot is written entirely to disk (we don't @fsync@),
      --        we have no choice but to start at the genesis snapshot on the
      --        next startup.
      -- * @2@: Always keep 2 snapshots around. This means that when we write
      --        the next snapshot, we delete the oldest one, leaving the middle
      --        one available in case of truncation of the write. This is
      --        probably a sane value in most circumstances.

      -- This function is passed two bits of information:

      -- * The time since the last snapshot, or 'NoSnapshotTakenYet' if none was taken yet.
      --   Note that 'NoSnapshotTakenYet' merely means no snapshot had been taking yet
      --   since the node was started; it does not necessarily mean that none
      --   exist on disk.
      --
      -- * The distance in terms of blocks applied to the /oldest/ ledger
      --   snapshot in memory. During normal operation, this is the number of
      --   blocks written to the ImmutableDB since the last snapshot. On
      --   startup, it is computed by counting how many immutable blocks we had
      --   to reapply to get to the chain tip. This is useful, as it allows the
      --   policy to decide to take a snapshot /on node startup/ if a lot of
      --   blocks had to be replayed.
