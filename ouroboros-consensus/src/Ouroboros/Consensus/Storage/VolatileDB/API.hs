      -- | Try to remove all blocks with a slot number less than the given

      --
      -- = Context
      --
      -- When the current chain changes, blocks older than @k@, i.e., blocks
      -- that are followed by @k@ blocks or more, become /immutable/. Whenever
      -- this happens, we schedule a garbage collection on the VolatileDB that
      -- will try to remove blocks older than the most recent immutable block,
      -- as such blocks will never be adopted. There's no point in storing
      -- them anymore.
      --
      -- = Block number vs slot number
      --
      -- While we typically talk in terms of /block numbers/ when discussing
      -- immutability, i.e., /@k@ blocks/, we use /slot number/ for garbage
      -- collection. We schedule a garbage collection for blocks with a /slot
      -- number/ less than the slot number of the immutable block, as opposed
      -- to the block number. The reason for this is that the VolatileDB is
      -- not aware of block numbers, only of slot numbers.
      --
      -- By using slot numbers for garbage collection, we might not /yet/ have
      -- garbage collected some blocks that could never be adopted again and
      -- that we would have garbage collected when using block numbers. This
      -- is harmless. The opposite direction is more important and
      -- problematic: garbage collecting a block that we might want to adopt
      -- after all. Say we have mistakenly garbage collected such a block, in
      -- that case the following would be true:
      --
      -- 1. The block has a slot number older than the immutable block's slot
      --    number: otherwise we wouldn't have mistakenly garbage collected
      --    it.
      --
      -- 2. The block has a block number greater than the immutable block's
      --    block number: otherwise we wouldn't want to adopt it, as it would
      --    have been older than @k@.
      --
      -- 3. The block is a part of a fork fitting on the immutable block. As
      --    we cannot roll back this block, all forks we could ever adopt
      --    would have to go through this block.
      --
      -- As slot numbers grow monotonically within a chain, all forks starting
      -- after the immutable block will only contain blocks with slot numbers
      -- greater (or equal to in case of EBBs) than the immutable block's slot
      -- number. This directly contradicts (1), so we will /never/ garbage
      -- collect a block that we might still want to adopt.
      --
      -- = Less than vs. less than or equal to
      --
      -- Note that we remove blocks with a slot number /less than/ the given
      -- slot number, but not /equal to/ it. In practice, this off-by-one
      -- difference will not matter in terms of disk space usage, because as
      -- soon as the chain grows again by at least one block, those blocks
      -- will be removed anyway. The reason for @<@ opposed to @<=@ is to
      -- avoid issues with /EBBs/, which have the same slot number as the
      -- block after it.
