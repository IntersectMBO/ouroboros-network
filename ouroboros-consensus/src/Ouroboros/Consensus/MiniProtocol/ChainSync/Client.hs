-- Our task: after connecting to an upstream node, try to maintain an
-- up-to-date header-only fragment representing their chain. We maintain
-- such candidate chains in a map with upstream nodes as keys.
--
-- The block fetch logic will use these candidate chains to download
-- blocks from, prioritising certain candidate chains over others using
-- the consensus protocol. Whenever such a block has been downloaded and
-- added to the local 'ChainDB', the 'ChainDB' will perform chain
-- selection.
--
-- We also validate the headers of a candidate chain by advancing the
-- 'ConsensusState' with the headers, which returns an error when validation
-- failed. Thus, in addition to the chain fragment of each candidate, we
-- also store a 'ConsensusState' corresponding to the head of the candidate
-- chain.
--
-- We must keep the candidate chain synchronised with the corresponding
-- upstream chain. The upstream node's chain might roll forward or
-- backwards, and they will inform us about this. When we get these
-- messages, we will replicate these actions on our candidate chain.

  TODO #221: Implement genesis

  Genesis in paper:

    When we compare a candidate to our own chain, and that candidate forks off
    more than k in the past, we compute the intersection point between that
    candidate and our chain, select s slots from both chains, and compare the
    number of blocks within those s slots. If the candidate has more blocks
    in those s slots, we prefer the candidate, otherwise we stick with our own
    chain.

  Genesis as we will implement it:

    * We decide we are in genesis mode if the head of our chain is more than
      @k@ blocks behind the blockchain time. We will have to approximate this
      as @k/f@ /slots/ behind the blockchain time time.
    * In this situation, we must make sure we have a sufficient number of
      upstream nodes "and collect chains from all of them"
    * We still never consider chains that would require /us/ to rollback more
      than k blocks.
    * In order to compare two candidates, we compute the intersection point of
      X of those two candidates and compare the density at point X.




  Scribbled notes during meeting with Duncan:

   geensis mode: compare clock to our chain
   do we have enough peers?
   still only interested in chains that don't fork more than k from our own chain

     downloading headers from a /single/ node, download at least s headers
     inform /other/ peers: "here is a point on our chain"
     if all agree ("intersection imporved") -- all peers agree
     avoid downloading tons of headers
     /if/ there is a difference, get s headers from the peer who disagrees,
       pick the denser one, and ignore the other
       PROBLEM: what if the denser node has invalid block bodies??
