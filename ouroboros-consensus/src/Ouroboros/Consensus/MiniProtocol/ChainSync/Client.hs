-- Our task: after connecting to an upstream node, try to maintain an
-- up-to-date header-only fragment representing their chain. We maintain
-- such candidate chains in a map with upstream nodes as keys.
--
-- The block fetch logic will use these candidate chains to download
-- blocks from, prioritising certain candidate chains over others using
-- the consensus protocol. Whenever such a block has been downloaded and
-- added to the local 'ChainDB', the 'ChainDB' will perform chain
-- selection.
--
-- We also validate the headers of a candidate chain by advancing the
-- 'ChainDepState' with the headers, which returns an error when validation
-- failed. Thus, in addition to the chain fragment of each candidate, we also
-- store a 'ChainDepState' corresponding to the head of the candidate chain.
--
-- We must keep the candidate chain synchronised with the corresponding
-- upstream chain. The upstream node's chain might roll forward or
-- backwards, and they will inform us about this. When we get these
-- messages, we will replicate these actions on our candidate chain.
--
-- INVARIANT:
--
-- >           our tip
-- >             v
-- >   /--* .... *
-- >   |
-- > --*
-- >   |
-- >   \--* .... *
-- >        fragment tip
--
-- The distance from our tip to the intersection between our chain and the
-- fragment maintained for the upstream node cannot exceed @k@ blocks. When
-- this invariant cannot be maintained, the upstream node is on a fork that
-- is too distant and we should disconnect.
--
-- TODO #423 rate-limit switching chains, otherwise we can't place blame (we
-- don't know which candidate's chain included the point that was
-- poisoned). E.g. two rollbacks per time slot -> make it configurable ->
-- just a simple argument for now.
--
-- TODO #467 if the 'theirTip' that they sent us is on our chain, just
-- switch to it.


-- = Candidate fragment size
-- -------------------------
--
-- The size of the downloaded candidate fragment ('theirFrag') and the
-- corresponding header state history ('theirHeaderStateHistory', which has the
-- same size as 'theirFrag') is limited by how far in the future the ledger view
-- can forecast.
--
-- For PBFT (Byron), we can forecast up to @2k@ slots ahead. Assuming a chain
-- density of 100%, this means the look-ahead is @2k@ headers. For mainnet this
-- means @2 * 2160 = 4320@ headers.
--
-- For TPraos (Shelley), we can forecast up to @3k/f@ slots ahead. Assuming a
-- density of @f@, this means the look-ahead is @3k@ headers. For mainnet, this
-- means @3 * 2160 = 6480@ headers.
--
-- The figure below shows the relation between 'ourFrag' and 'theirFrag':
--
-- >                       k headers or less, when A is genesis
-- >              <--------------------->
-- >            anchor    header       tip
-- >              |         |           |
-- >              V         V           V
-- > 'ourFrag':   A-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-...-H
-- >                     \
-- > 'theirFrag':         H-H-H-H-...   ...   ...
-- >                    ^
-- >                    |
-- >           most recent intersection (between A and the tip)
--
-- Note that the 'ourFrag' and 'theirFrag' share anchors /at all times/. In the
-- figure above, the first three headers on 'ourFrag' are thus also on
-- 'theirFrag'. The further away the most recent intersection is from the anchor
-- point, the more headers 'theirFrag' and 'ourFrag' will have in common.
--
-- In the \"worst\" case 'theirFrag' has the following length:
--
-- >                        k
-- >              <--------------------->
-- > 'ourFrag':   A-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-...-H
-- >                                    \
-- > 'theirFrag':                        H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H...-H
-- >                                     <-------------------------------->
-- >                                               max look-ahead
-- > max length   <------------------------------------------------------->
-- > of 'theirFrag'         k + max look-ahead
--
-- For PBFT this is @2160 + 4320 = 6480@ headers, for TPraos this is @2160 +
-- 6480 = 8640@ headers. The header state history will have the same length.
--
-- This worst case can happen when:
-- * We are more than 6480 or respectively 8640 blocks behind, bulk syncing, and
--   the BlockFetch client and/or the ChainDB can't keep up with the ChainSync
--   client.
-- * When our clock is running behind such that we are not adopting the
--   corresponding blocks because we think they are from the future.
-- * When an attacker is serving us headers from the future.
--
-- When we are in sync with the network, the fragment will typically be @k@ to
-- @k + 1@ headers long.

  TODO #221: Implement genesis

  Genesis in paper:

    When we compare a candidate to our own chain, and that candidate forks off
    more than k in the past, we compute the intersection point between that
    candidate and our chain, select s slots from both chains, and compare the
    number of blocks within those s slots. If the candidate has more blocks
    in those s slots, we prefer the candidate, otherwise we stick with our own
    chain.

  Genesis as we will implement it:

    * We decide we are in genesis mode if the head of our chain is more than
      @k@ blocks behind the blockchain time. We will have to approximate this
      as @k/f@ /slots/ behind the blockchain time time.
    * In this situation, we must make sure we have a sufficient number of
      upstream nodes "and collect chains from all of them"
    * We still never consider chains that would require /us/ to rollback more
      than k blocks.
    * In order to compare two candidates, we compute the intersection point of
      X of those two candidates and compare the density at point X.




  Scribbled notes during meeting with Duncan:

   geensis mode: compare clock to our chain
   do we have enough peers?
   still only interested in chains that don't fork more than k from our own chain

     downloading headers from a /single/ node, download at least s headers
     inform /other/ peers: "here is a point on our chain"
     if all agree ("intersection imporved") -- all peers agree
     avoid downloading tons of headers
     /if/ there is a difference, get s headers from the peer who disagrees,
       pick the denser one, and ignore the other
       PROBLEM: what if the denser node has invalid block bodies??
