-- | Each block has its limits of how many transactions it can hold.
-- That limit is compared against the sum of measurements
-- taken of each of the transactions in that block.
--
-- How we measure the transaction depends of the era that this
-- transaction belongs to (more specifically it depends on the block
-- type to which this transaction will be added). For initial eras
-- (like Byron and initial generations of Shelley based eras) this
-- measure was simply a ByteSize (block could not be bigger then
-- given size - in bytes - specified by the ledger state). In future
-- eras (starting with Alonzo) this measure was a bit more complex
-- as it had to take other factors into account (like execution units).
-- For details please see the individual instances for the TxLimits.

-- | An override that lowers a capacity limit
--
-- Specifically, we use this override to let the node operator limit the total
-- 'TxMeasure' of transactions in blocks even more severely than would the
-- ledger state's 'txsBlockCapacity'. The forge logic will use the 'Measure.min'
-- (ie the lattice's @meet@ operator) to combine this override with the capacity
-- given by the ledger state. More concretely, that will typically be a
-- componentwise minimum operation, along each of the components\/dimensions of
-- @'TxMeasure' blk@.
--
-- This newtype wrapper distinguishes the intention of this particular
-- 'TxMeasure' as such an override. We use 'TxMeasure' in different ways in this
-- code base. The newtype also allows us to distinguish the one most appropriate
-- monoid among many offered by the 'TxLimits' superclass constraints: it is the
-- monoid induced by the bounded meet-semilattice (see 'BoundedMeasure') that is
-- relevant to the notion of /overriding/ the ledger's block capacity.
