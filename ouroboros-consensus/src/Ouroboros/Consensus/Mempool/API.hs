-- | Mempool
--
-- The mempool is the set of transactions that should be included in the next
-- block. In principle this is a /set/ of all the transactions that we receive
-- from our peers. In order to avoid flooding the network with invalid
-- transactions, however, we only want to keep /valid/ transactions in the
-- mempool. That raises the question: valid with respect to which ledger state?
--
-- We opt for a very simple answer to this: the mempool will be interpreted
-- as a /list/ of transactions; which are validated strictly in order, starting
-- from the current ledger state. This has a number of advantages:
--
-- * It's simple to implement and it's efficient. In particular, no search for
--   a valid subset is ever required.
-- * When producing a block, we can simply take the longest possible prefix
--   of transactions that fits in a block.
-- * It supports wallets that submit dependent transactions (where later
--   transaction depends on outputs from earlier ones).
--
-- When only one thread is operating on the mempool, operations that mutate the
-- state based on the input arguments (tryAddTxs and removeTxs) will produce the
-- same result whether they process transactions one by one or all in one go, so
-- this equality holds:
--
-- > void (tryAddTxs wti txs) === forM_ txs (tryAddTxs wti . (:[]))
-- > void (trAddTxs wti [x,y]) === tryAddTxs wti x >> void (tryAddTxs wti y)
--
-- This shows that @'tryAddTxs' wti@ is an homomorphism from '++' and '>>',
-- which informally makes these operations "distributive".
data Mempool m blk idx = Mempool {
      -- | Add a bunch of transactions (oldest to newest)
      --
      -- As long as we keep the mempool entirely in-memory this could live in
      -- @STM m@; we keep it in @m@ instead to leave open the possibility of
      -- persistence.
      --
      -- The new transactions provided will be validated, /in order/, against
      -- the ledger state obtained by applying all the transactions already in
      -- the Mempool to it. Transactions which are found to be invalid, with
      -- respect to the ledger state, are dropped, whereas valid transactions
      -- are added to the mempool.
      --
      -- Note that transactions that are invalid, with respect to the ledger
      -- state, will /never/ be added to the mempool. However, it is possible
      -- that, at a given point in time, transactions which were once valid
      -- but are now invalid, with respect to the current ledger state, could
      -- exist within the mempool until they are revalidated and dropped from
      -- the mempool via a call to 'syncWithLedger' or by the background
      -- thread that watches the ledger for changes.
      --
      -- This function will return two lists
      --
      -- 1. A list containing the following transactions:
      --
      --    * Those transactions provided which were found to be valid, as a
      --      'MempoolTxAdded' value. These transactions are now in the Mempool.
      --    * Those transactions provided which were found to be invalid, along
      --      with their accompanying validation errors, as a
      --      'MempoolTxRejected' value. These transactions are not in the
      --      Mempool.
      --
      -- 2. A list containing the transactions that have not yet been added, as
      --    the capacity of the Mempool has been reached. I.e., there is no
      --    space in the Mempool to add the first transaction in this list. Note
      --    that we won't try to add smaller transactions after that first
      --    transaction because they might depend on the first transaction.
      --
      -- POSTCONDITION:
      -- > let prj = \case
      -- >       MempoolTxAdded vtx        -> txForgetValidated vtx
      -- >       MempoolTxRejected tx _err -> tx
      -- > (processed, toProcess) <- tryAddTxs wti txs
      -- > map prj processed ++ toProcess == txs
      --
      -- Note that previously valid transaction that are now invalid with
      -- respect to the current ledger state are dropped from the mempool, but
      -- are not part of the first returned list (nor the second).
      --
      -- In principle it is possible that validation errors are transient; for
      -- example, it is possible that a transaction is rejected because one of
      -- its inputs is not /yet/ available in the UTxO (the transaction it
      -- depends on is not yet in the chain, nor in the mempool). In practice
      -- however it is likely that rejected transactions will still be
      -- rejected later, and should just be dropped.
      --
      -- It is important to note one important special case of transactions
      -- being "invalid": a transaction will /also/ be considered invalid if
      -- /that very same transaction/ is already included on the blockchain
      -- (after all, by definition that must mean its inputs have been used).
      -- Rejected transactions are therefore not necessarily a sign of
      -- malicious behaviour. Indeed, we would expect /most/ transactions that
      -- are reported as invalid by 'tryAddTxs' to be invalid precisely
      -- because they have already been included. Distinguishing between these
      -- two cases can be done in theory, but it is expensive unless we have
      -- an index of transaction hashes that have been included on the
      -- blockchain.
