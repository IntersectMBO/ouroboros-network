-- | Mempool
--
-- The mempool is the set of transactions that should be included in the next
-- block. In principle this is a /set/ of all the transactions that we receive
-- from our peers. In order to avoid flooding the network with invalid
-- transactions,  however, we only want to keep /valid/ transactions in the
-- mempool. That raises the question: valid with respect to which ledger state?
--
-- We opt for a very simple answer to this: the mempool will be interpreted
-- as a /list/ of transactions; which are validated strictly in order, starting
-- from the current ledger state. This has a number of advantages:
--
-- * It's simple to implement and it's efficient. In particular, no search for
--   a valid subset is ever required.
-- * When producing a block, we can simply take the longest possible prefix
--   of transactions that fits in a block.
-- * It supports wallets that submit dependent transactions (where later
--   transaction depends on outputs from earlier ones).
data Mempool m blk = Mempool {
      -- | Add a bunch of transactions (oldest to newest)
      --
      -- As long as we keep the mempool entirely in-memory this could live in
      -- @STM m@; we keep it in @m@ instead to leave open the possibility of
      -- persistence.
      --
      -- The transactions will be validated, /in order/, before they are added
      -- to the mempool. Invalid transactions will be returned along with the
      -- validation error. In principle it is possible that such validation
      -- errors are transient; for example, it is possible that a transaction is
      -- rejected because one of its inputs is not /yet/ available in the UTxO
      -- (the transaction it depends on is not yet in the chain, nor in the
      -- mempool). In practice however it is likely that rejected transactions
      -- will still be rejected later, and should just be dropped.
      --
      -- It is important to note one important special case of transactions
      -- being "invalid": a transaction will /also/ be considered invalid if
      -- /that very same transaction/ is already included on the blockchain
      -- (after all, by definition that must mean its inputs have been used).
      -- Rejected transactions are therefore not necessarily a sign of
      -- malicious behaviour. Indeed, we would expect /most/ transactions that
      -- are reported as invalid by 'addTxs' to be invalid precisely because
      -- they have already been included. (Distinguishing between these two
      -- cases can be done in theory, but it is expensive unless we have an
      -- index of transaction hashes that have been included on the blockchain.)
