-- = Constructing candidate fragments
--
-- The VolatileDB keeps a \"successors\" map in memory, telling us the hashes
-- of the known successors of any block, but it does not keep /headers/ in
-- memory, which are needed to construct candidate fargments. We try to reuse
-- the headers from the current chain fragment where possible, but it will not
-- contain all needed headers. This means that we will need to read some
-- blocks from disk and extract their headers. Under normal circumstances this
-- does not matter too much; although this will be done every time we add a
-- block, the expected number of headers to read from disk is very small:
--
-- * None if we stay on the current chain and this is just the next block
-- * A handful if we stay on the current chain and the block we just received
--   was a missing block and we already received some of its successors
-- * A handful if we switch to a short fork
--
-- This is expensive only
--
-- * on startup: in this case we need to read at least @k@ blocks from the
--   VolatileDB, and possibly more if there are some other chains in the
--   VolatileDB starting from the tip of the ImmutableDB
-- * when we switch to a distant fork
--

    -- chain came from which peer, so we can't simply reject a peer's chain.

    -- It might be that a good peer gave us a valid chain, but another peer
    -- gave us an invalid block that fits onto the chain of the good peer. In

    -- is a prefix of the chain that we constructed using all the blocks we
    -- found in the VolatileDB, including the invalid block.

    -- This is the reason why we still take valid prefixes of a invalid chains
    -- into account during chain selection: they might correspond to the good
    -- peer's valid chain.
