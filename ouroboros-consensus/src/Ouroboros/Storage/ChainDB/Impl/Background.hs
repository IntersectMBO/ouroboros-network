  Scheduling garbage collections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

-- | A scheduled garbage collections.
--
-- Represented as a queue.
--
-- The background thread will continuously try to pop the first element of the
-- queue. Whenever it manages to pop a @('Time', 'SlotNo')@ off: it first
-- waits until the 'Time' is passed (using 'threadDelay' with the given 'Time'
-- minus the current 'Time') and then performs a garbage collection with the
-- given 'SlotNo'.
--
-- The 'Time's in the queue should be monotonically increasing. A fictional
-- example (with hh:mm:ss):
--
-- > [(16:01:12, SlotNo 1012), (16:04:38, SlotNo 1045), ..]
--
-- By using 'scheduleGC', monotonicity is practically guaranteed for standard
-- usage. Theoretically, multiple concurrent calls to 'scheduleGC' might
-- violate it, but this won't happen in practice, as it would mean that
-- multiple calls to 'copyToImmDB' (which cannot run concurrent with itself)
-- have finished very short after each other. Even then, the differences will
-- be ignorable (<1s), and actually won't matter at all, as garbage collection
-- timing doesn't have to be precise. In fact, it is exactly the goal to
-- introduce a delay between copying blocks from the ImmutableDB to the
-- VolatileDB and garbage-collecting them from the VolatileDB.
--
-- If a 'Time' @t@ in the queue /is/ earlier than the 'Time' @t'@ before it in
-- the queue, then the GC scheduled for @t@ will simply be executed at @t'@.
--
-- All this combined means that a garbage collection scheduled at 'Time' @t@
-- will be performed at @t@ /or/ later (but never earlier), with no hard
-- guarantees about how much later.
--
-- How long will this queue be in practice?
--
-- If we say a block is produced every 20 seconds, then a new GC is scheduled
-- every 20 seconds. Ignoring start-up, the queue will then be @delay / 20s@
-- entries long. For example, if the delay is 1h, then the queue will be 180
-- entries long, which is acceptable.
--
-- In Praos, the slot length decreases, but the number of blocks produced (per
-- time) will remain the same as the density decreases too (more slots, but
-- many of them empty), hence the queue queue length will also remain the
-- same.
