-- | API for the 'ImmutableDB'.
--
-- The 'ImmutableDB' stores binary blobs in 'SlotNo's, i.e. the blocks of a
-- chain.
--
-- The database is append-only, so you cannot append a blob to a slot in the
-- past. You can, however, skip slots, e.g., append to slot 0 and then to slot
-- 5, but afterwards, you can no longer append to slots 1-4. You can only
-- store at most one blob in each slot. It is not allowed to store an empty
-- blob in a slot (we would need a way to distinguish an empty blob from an
-- empty slot).
--
-- The blob stored in a slot can be queried with 'getBinaryBlob'. Blobs can be
-- efficiently streamed using 'Iterator's, see 'streamBinaryBlobs'.
--
-- An Epoch Boundary Block (EBB) can be appended to the start of each epoch
-- using 'appendEBB'.
--
-- The 'Tip' of the database can be queried with 'getTip'. This tip will
-- always point to a filled slot or an EBB that is present.
--
-- It is possible to delete blobs from the database using 'deleteAfter'.
--
-- The database can be explicitly closed, but can also be automatically closed
-- in case of an 'Ouroboros.Storage.ImmutableDB.Types.UnexpectedError'. Use
-- 'reopen' to reopen the database.
