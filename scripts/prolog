  sockets.  These are higher level components, which don't dependent on
  ouroboros protocols, but build a solid foundation for the networking
  library

== Ouroboros Consensus

This graph depicts the relationship between the various `xxx-consensus-yyy` packages:

![Consensus packages dependencies](packages-consensus.svg)

* __ouroboros-consensus__ : Main package for Cardano consensus implementation, aka. Ouroboros.

    * The [Ouroboros Consensus Modules Map](./modules-consensus.svg) represents the dependencies between various /Consensus/ modules and is a map to navigate the (large) codebase. Clicking on a module should bring you to the corresponding haddock page from which you can later navigate to the source code. __Note__: The image needs to be enlarged to be useful hence why it's an external link.

=== Consensus Components

The following  [C4 Component Diagram](https://c4model.com/) provides a high-level overview of the main components involved in /Consensus/. Note that clicking on
a box should link to the corresponding documentation:

![Ouroboros Consensus Components](./Consensus.svg)

=== Testing in the consensus layer

The vast majority of the tests in the consensus layer are QuickCheck property
tests, and many of these are model based. There are only a handful of unit
tests. The consensus layer is an intricate piece of software with lots of
components, which we set at virtually every level of granularity. Below we give
an overview of the tests that we do per component. For the detailed listing,
please refer to the various test suites within the [repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/).

* The hard fork combinator, time infrastructure: One of the responsibilities of
  the HFC is to offer time conversions (slot to epoch, wall clock to slot, etc.)
  across era transitions (which might change parameters such as the slot length
  and the epoch size). It does this by constructing a "summary" of the current
  state of the chain, basically recording what the various slot lengths and
  epoch sizes have been so far, and how far ahead we can look (the so-called
  "safe zone": if the transition to the next era is not yet known, there must
  exist a limited period after the ledger tip in which we can still time
  conversions).

      __[Test.Consensus.HardFork.Summary](ouroboros-consensus-test-test-consensus/Test-Consensus-HardFork-Summary.html)__.

    * The tests for the hard fork history can be found in

==== Consensus tests

The main consensus tests are the consensus layer's sophisticated tests. They are
"system level" tests, in which we set up a mock network of nodes, where we can
simulate things like nodes joining late, network message delay, etc. We then
have these nodes run the full protocol, exchanging blocks, doing chain
selection, etc. Finally we verify that the nodes can reach consensus. We have
some generic infrastructure for doing all of this, and then have specific tests
for each of the protocols/ledgers we support.

In a way, these are the most important tests we have, as they are testing
properties of the system as a whole. Of course, that also means that if
something goes wrong, debugging these tests can be difficult, and it would be
better to have such problems caught by the other, more fine-grained, tests.

We run these tests for

* A mock ledger (containing bare bones UTxO style transactions) using a variety
  of consensus protocols: BFT, PBFT, Praos, and a version of Praos where we
  override the leader schedule. See [this directory](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/tree/master/ouroboros-consensus-mock-test/test/Test/ThreadNet).
* Byron/PBFT. See
  __[Test.ThreadNet.Byron](ouroboros-consensus-byron-test-test/Test-ThreadNet-Byron.html)__.
* DualByron. See
  __[Test.ThreadNet.DualByron](ouroboros-consensus-byron-test-test/Test-ThreadNet-DualByron.html)__.
* Shelley/TPraos. See
  __[Test.ThreadNet.Shelley](ouroboros-consensus-shelley-test-test/Test-ThreadNet-Shelley.html)__.
* The hard fork combinator transitioning from a mock ledger @A@ to a mock ledger @B@;
  these mock ledgers are absolutely minimal ledgers: the only transaction supported
  on the @A@ ledger is "initiate transition to @B@", and the @B@ ledger can only contain
  blocks with a header only, no body at all.
* @HardForkBlock '[Byron, Shelley]@: the hard fork combinator instantiated with
  the Byron and Shelley ledgers, running @PBFT@ before the transition and
  @TPraos@ after.
